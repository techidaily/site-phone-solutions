Here are the steps about how to reset Android to unlock lock screen.

- **Step 1: Launch Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) and connect your Android device.**

First, install and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer. Select the “Screen Unlock” option from the main interface and then click “Android” > “Unlock Android Screen”. Using a USB cable, connect your Android tablet to the computer.

- **Step 2: Select your device brand and follow the guide to restart your device.**

Dr.Fone will ask you to select your device brand and display the specific way to restart the Motorola Edge+ (2023) device. You need to select your device brand in this step because the unlock way of different device brands is different. And then follow the instructions to restart your device.

- **Step 3: The lock screen of your device is removed.**

Wait for the reboot process to complete, and then you can access the phone or tablet without the password.

## Conclusion

So these are the methods with which you can do a reset without using volume buttons. The difficulty level of the methods depends on the type and brand of the Android device. The first two parts can be performed easily by anyone, and that too in a matter of a few minutes. However, the third method may pose some difficulty, particularly because manufacturers set different key combinations for rebooting the Motorola Edge+ (2023) device into recovery. Nevertheless, once it is figured out, the rest is easy. Hence, it is up to you to decide on the method to be adopted for hard resetting your Android device.
