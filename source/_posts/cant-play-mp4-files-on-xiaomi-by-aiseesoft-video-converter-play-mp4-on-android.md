    MP4 is a widely accepted video format. Almost all popular devices and media players are able to play video files in this format. But why people are still stuck when playing MP4 files on Xiaomi 14 Ultra? This is not complicated or difficult to explain - MP4 is a container format which can include various data like video, audio, subtitle, image, etc. Once the MP4 file that you want to play on Xiaomi 14 Ultra is encoded with a codec incompatible with your device, Xiaomi 14 Ultra will refuse to play it correctly. To solve the issue, you need to convert your MP4 files to H.264 encoded MP4.
