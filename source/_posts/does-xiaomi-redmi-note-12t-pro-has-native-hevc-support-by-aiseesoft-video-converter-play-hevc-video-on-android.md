    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro and it failed terribly. Does Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
