## Unlock Locked iPhone 6s Plus by Restoring it to Default Settings – iTunes

iPhone users make sure that they connect and sync their devices with iTunes because their data is safe. iPhone users live without the fear of losing their data because it is backed up. Taking more advantage of this, iPhone users can restore their phone to default settings and can even unlock their iPhone without using a passcode.

Let us show you how to unlock iPhone 6s Plus without using a passcode;

1. Start the process by turning off your iPhone 6s Plus.
2. After that, plug in your phone to the computer and open iTunes.
3. Once the phone is connected with iTunes, click on 'Summary' that will appear on the screen's left side.

4. After the summary screen is opened, you will see the option of 'Restore iPhone'; click on that option.

5. This option will bring you to a new window that will be asking for your confirmation on the decision to restore your device.
6. As soon as that is done and iTunes has finished the process, your iPhone 6s Plus will be restored to default settings.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone 6s Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone 6s Plus is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 6s Plus to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

- **Step 2**: Pick your iPhone 6s Plus and do the following:
  - (2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.
  - (2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.
  - (2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your iPhone 6s Plus) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

- **Step 3**: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your iPhone 6s Plus and unlock your iPhone 6s Plus.

When the iPhone 6s Plus reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Is It Possible to Unlock iPhone 6s Plus without a Passcode?

Unlocking an iPhone 6s Plus without a passcode is possible, but it's not as simple as entering a code. Besides, there are different methods that you can follow to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus

And we are going to teach all those methods with some simple steps. So, without any further ado, let's get started.

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the `Find My iPhone` function, then you can try it to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![Use Find My iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.
- **Step 2**: Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.
- **Step 3**: Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.
- **Step 4**: Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your iPhone 6s Plus from the list of devices.
- **Step 5**: Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.
- **Step 6**: Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus:

![Unlock it with iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/2.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 6s Plus to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.
- **Step 2**: Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.
- **Step 3**: Once recognized, your iPhone 6s Plus will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.
- **Step 4**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.
- **Step 5**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus:

![Use Recovery Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/3.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 6s Plus to the computer and launch the iTunes application.
- **Step 2**: Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.
- **Step 3**: As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.
- **Step 4**: On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.
- **Step 5**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.
- **Step 6**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use a Third-Party Tool

If you are unable to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus using the above methods, you can use a third-party tool like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/). This tool is designed to help you unlock your iPhone 6s Plus without a passcode. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock to unlock your iPhone 6s Plus:

- **Step 1**: Start Dr.Fone on your computer. Then, launch the program and select `Screen Unlock`.

![screen unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/4.avif)

- **Step 2**: Create the connection from your iPhone 6s Plus to the computer with a lightning cable.

![create connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/5.avif)

- **Step 3**: Follow the image on the screen to make your device enter in `DFU mode` or `Recovery mode`.

- **Step 4**: Once your device gets into DFU mode or Recovery mode, Dr.Fone will ask you to choose the right firmware for your iPhone 6s Plus.

![choose firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/6.avif)

- **Step 5**: Upon selecting the right firmware, Dr.Fone will start downloading the firmware for your device. Once it's finished, click "Unlock Now" to remove the Passcode.

![unlock now](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/7.avif)

You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your iPhone 6s Plus.

Once the process is completed, your iPhone 6s Plus will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your iPhone 6s Plus passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.




## Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/2.avif)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your iPhone 6s Plus would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone 6s Plus Without iTunes/ iCloud

You do not want that. How about a way you could unlock your iPhone 6s Plus in a simple, 1-click way instead?

Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) is a tool that can help you unlock your iPhone 6s Plus without iTunes or iCloud. It is a simple and easy-to-use tool that can help you unlock your iPhone 6s Plus in a few minutes. It is a safe and reliable tool that can help you unlock your iPhone 6s Plus without any data loss.

Your iPhone 6s Plus will be unlocked in a short span of time. Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the device. When you set the device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your iPhone 6s Plus prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the device again.


## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone 6s Plus 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.
