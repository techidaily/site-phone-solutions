That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Vivo T2x 5G. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Vivo T2x 5G app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.

**Step 5:** In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

**Step 4:** Choose if you want to repeat this route and click Match to start the fun.

## Part IV: FAQs

Here are some commonly asked questions to help you with location spoofer Vivo T2x 5G apps.

### FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Vivo T2x 5G app damage my Vivo T2x 5G or its GPS?

Not in the least. Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer on Vivo T2x 5G works from the computer and does not affect either the Vivo T2x 5G or the GPS chip inside the Vivo T2x 5G. So when you want to come back to your real location, all you need to do is restart the Vivo T2x 5G.

### FAQ 2: Do I need to jailbreak to use a location spoofer Vivo T2x 5G app?

Can't say for other apps in the market, but Wondershare Dr.Fone – Virtual Location does not require you to jailbreak your Vivo T2x 5G. It works using the computer to temporarily change the GPS coordinates of your Vivo T2x 5G, and you can stop spoofing your location anytime by simply restarting your handset. It does not cause security issues with iOS or risk your privacy at all.

### FAQ 3: Can I jailbreak Vivo T2x 5G to spoof location using Cydia?

The jailbreakers are only catching up to iOS 15 right now. It is being reported that they are close to jailbreaking iOS 15. As you are running iOS 16, you cannot jailbreak Vivo T2x 5G to spoof location using Cydia. Furthermore, jailbreaking is not recommended in today's age given the security and privacy risks it poses.

### Conclusion

Location spoofer Vivo T2x 5G apps are gaining prevalence today mostly among gamers who use these GPS spoofer Vivo T2x 5G apps to catch more Pokémon. However, anyone can use a location changer on Vivo T2x 5G for several other benefits such as breaking the geo-restrictions in dating apps and streaming websites to find dates outside your city limits for free and accessing a catalog of movies and TV shows that is not available in your region due to licensing or other considerations. There are several Vivo T2x 5G location spoofer apps in the market, each extolling its virtues. None of them, however, come close to Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) spoofer on Vivo T2x 5G given its intuitive interface and ease of use. Not only can you use it on iOS 16 without problem as this app works from a computer, but you also do not have to think about security issues that jailbreaking a device brings because Dr.Fone Virtual Location changer on Vivo T2x 5G works without jailbreaking the Vivo T2x 5G.
