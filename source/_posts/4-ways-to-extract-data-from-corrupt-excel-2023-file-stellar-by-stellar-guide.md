Imagine the frustration of an employee if an Excel workbook he took hours to complete became corrupted for some reason threatening to erase all the data saved in it. Not just that, a corrupted Excel workbook can wreak havoc for the organization too since it poses a risk of permanently deleting critical business information like work records or employee trackers.

Unless a backup of all important Excel files exists, recovering data lost due to damage/corruption to them is next to impossible. However, we’ve conducted some research and found some pretty neat hacks to help you extract data from corrupt excel files without much hassle.

## Primary reasons triggering Excel file corruption

As we always point out, to solve a problem for good, getting to its root is imperative. Here are the main reasons that cause Excel file corruption. Knowing these reasons can help you keep Excel corruption at bay for a considerably long time.

- Abrupt system shutdown when you’re editing an Excel sheet
- Bugs / Defects in your Excel application or installation
- Hardware failures like bad sectors on the hard drive where Excel sheets are saved
- Virus Infection / Malware Attack
- Excessive data storage within a single Excel file
- Faulty Excel Macros and CSE Formulas

Depending upon the extent of damage, there can be several ways to perform corrupt Excel file repair.

## How to repair corrupt Excel files?

There are a couple of manual methods that can help you [repair corrupt Excel files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

1. **If the damaged Excel sheet can be opened, immediately save its copy; thereafter**:
    - Open it with a later version of Excel and save it as a new workbook.
    - If this doesn’t work, open it in Excel’s latest version and save the workbook in HTML or HTM format.
    - Once this is done, reopen the HTML file and save again in XLS format.
    - Lastly, open the file and try saving it in SLK format (symbolic link)

**Note:** It is important to note that saving an Excel workbook in HTML format causes loss of features like custom views, scenarios, unused styles or number formats, natural language formulas, data consolidation settings, custom function categories, etc. In SYLK format only the active worksheet is saved so if using this method, you’ll need to repeat these steps for each worksheet.

2. **Use Excel’s inbuilt Repair function as follows:**
    - Launch Microsoft Excel and go to **Office button -> Open**
    - In the Open dialog box, select the damaged Excel file
    - On the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog box, you will find a drop-down next to **Open** Click on it and select **Open and Repair**
    - This will launch the inbuilt Repair module of Excel and you’ll see a dialog box asking you to select an option from **Repair** or **Extract Data**
    - Click on **Repair** to initiate the repair process.
    - If this doesn’t work, repeat steps 1-4, and when Excel asks you to select an option, select **Extract Data** from corrupt excel file. Thereafter, follow the instruction Excel shows and you should be able to retrieve your data, but you may end up losing some formulas.
3. **If you cannot open the Excel, download Spreadsheet viewer from the Microsoft website and open the file using this program. Thereafter copy all data into a new Excel.**

**Note:** This method will cause much of your formatting, formulas, and more to be lost.

4. **You can download Open Office from its official website OpenOffice.org and try opening the Excel in it. The two programs are very similar so all data should automatically align in the correct place and with the correct formatting.**

**Note:** With this method, VBA code cannot be recovered due to incompatibility between OpenOffice.org and Excel.

Try any of these workarounds to fix the error and regain access to your Excel file data:

### **Workaround 1 – Change the Default File Format**

By default, an Excel file is saved in .xlsx or .xls file format. Trying to open the file with a different or incorrect extension may cause the 'Excel cannot open the file because the extension is not valid' error. To fix the error, try changing the Excel default file format by following these steps:

**_Note:_** _Take a backup of the Excel file that you cannot open and try the steps on the backup copy._

-   In Excel 2010 and newer versions, click on the **File** menu.

**_Note:_** _For Excel 2007 and earlier versions, click on the Office button._

-   On the left panel, click on **Options**. 
-   In 'Excel Options' window, under **Save workbooks** section, click on the **Save files in this file format:** drop-down. Select a file format (i.e., the one supported by your Excel version).

![Save Workbook in Other File Format](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/save-workbook-in-other-file-format-2.png)

-   Click **OK**.

Check if you can open your Excel file. If not, try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Edit the Excel File Permissions**

You may receive the 'Excel file format or file extension is not valid' error if you lack sufficient permissions to open the file. Usually this happens when you try to open an Excel file received from some other user. Follow these steps to change the file permissions and see if it fixes the problem:

-   Right-click on the file that won't open and click **Properties**.
-   In the file properties dialog box, click the **Security** tab and then hit the **Edit** button.

![Edit Excel File Properties](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/edit-excel-file-properties-3-1-e1624255637114.png)

-   When the file's permissions dialog box appears, click on the **Add** button.

![Add Excel File Permissions](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/add-excel-file-permissions-4.png)

-   Click on the **Advanced** button from the 'Select Users or Groups' window.

![Open Advanced Settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-advanced-settings-5.png)

-   Select **Find Now**. A list of all users and groups will get displayed in a search results box. Choose **Everyone** group from the list and hit **OK**.

![Select Everyone Group](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/select-everyone-group-6.png)

-   You can see the 'Everyone' group in the 'Enter the object names to select' textbox. Click **OK** once again to return to the file's permission dialog box.

![Everyone Group is Added Users Groups](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/everyone-group-is-added-users-groups-7.png)

-   Click **Everyone** from the Group or user names: box and check all the checkboxes under Allow.

![Allow Permissions for Everyone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/allow-permissions-for-everyone-8-1-e1624260058974.png)

-   Click on **Apply** and then **OK**.

Now try to open the Excel file. If you're still getting the Excel file cannot open error, use the following workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Recover Unsaved Workbook**

If the 'Excel file extension not valid error' occurs when attempting to open an unsaved workbook, do the following to recover the unsaved workbook:

-   In Excel, click **File.** 
-   From the Info screen, under **Manage Versions**, click **Recover Unsaved Workbooks**.

![Recover Unsaved Workbooks](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/recover-unsaved-workbooks-9.png)

Excel will list any unsaved files. Try opening the file and save it. If this doesn't work, skip to the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Repair the Workbook**

If none of the above workarounds has worked for you, chances are that the Excel file has become corrupted. Try to repair the file using the Excel inbuilt 'Open and Repair' utility by following these steps:

-   In your Excel application, click on **File** > **Open**.
-   In the 'Open' dialog box that pops-up, select the Excel file you want to repair and click the arrow next to the **Open** button.

![Select Excel File for Repairing](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/select-excel-file-for-repairing-10.png)

![Open and Repair Excel File](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-and-repair-excel-file-11.png)

## Workarounds to Resolve the 'Excel found unreadable content in filename.xls' Error

There is no permanent solution to fix the 'Excel found unreadable content' error. But, following are some workarounds you can try to resolve the error.

**_Note:_** _Before you try any of these workarounds, run Excel with administrator privileges and try opening the Excel file that is throwing the 'unreadable content' error. If this doesn't fix the error, proceed with the workarounds below._

### **Workaround 1 – Try Opening the File in Excel 2003**

Sometimes a problem in the current Excel version might prevent a file from opening. To resolve this error, try opening the problematic file in Excel 2003. If the file opens, save the data in a web page file format (.html) and then try opening the .html file in MS Excel 2010/2007. The detailed step-wise instructions are as follows:

- Open the .xls file in Excel 2003.
- When the file opens, click on File > Save.
- In the 'Save As' dialog box, choose Web Page (.html) as the 'Save as type' and then click 'Save.' Doing so will save everything from your .xls file, opened with 2003, in .html file format.
- Open the .html file in Excel 2010/2007. And then, save the file with .xlsx extension with a new name to avoid overwriting the original file.

Now, open the Excel 2010/2007 file and check if the error is fixed. If not, use the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Make the Excel File 'Read-only'**

Try to open your '.xlsx' file by making it 'read-only'. Follow these steps:

- In Excel, click 'File' from the main menu.
- Select 'Save' for a new document or 'Save As' for a previously saved document in the screen that appears.

![Excel File Saving Options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-file-saving-options-image-3.png)

- From the 'Save As' dialog box, click Tools > General Options.

![Open General Options In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Open-general-options-in-excel-image-4.png)

- Click on the 'Read-only recommended' checkbox to make the document read-only and then click 'OK'.

![Select Read Only Recommended Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Select-read-only-recommended-option-image-5.png)

Now open a new '.xlsx' file and copy everything from the corrupt Excel file to this new file. Finally, save this file and try to open it again.

### **Workaround 3 – Move Excel File to a New Folder**

Some users have reported that they could open their Excel file, following the 'Excel unreadable content' error, by simply moving the file to a different folder and saving it under a new name. You can also move the affected file to a new folder and try opening it. If this didn't help resolve the error, follow the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Install Visual Basic Component**

At times, it is seen that installing the 'Visual Basic' component of MS Office 2010 resolves the 'Excel found unreadable content 2010' error. To do so, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Control Panel > Programs and select Microsoft Office 2010.
- Click 'Change' and then select 'Add or Remove Programs'.
- Next, click the 'plus' sign provided next to Office Shared Features.
- Click 'Visual Basic for Applications'. After that, right-click and choose 'Run from My Computer' and hit the 'Continue' button.

**“Errors were detected while saving \[file name\]. Microsoft Excel may be able to save the file by removing or repairing some features. To make the repairs in a new file, click Continue. To cancel saving the file, click Cancel.”  
**

The error can occur if the features (Pivot tables, charts, macros) used in the [Excel file get corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). However, there could be several other reasons behind the occurrence of the error. Let’s discuss them.

## **What Causes the "Errors were detected while saving Excel" Error?**

There are various reasons why you encounter this error. Here are some of them:

- Incompatible pivot table in the Excel file
- Large or uncompressed images in the Excel file
- File-sharing properties are not allowing file saving
- Excel file is corrupted
- Large-sized Excel file
- File version incompatibility
- VBA code is corrupted

## **Ways to Fix the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” Error**

You’re not able to save the Excel file if there is no storage space on your hard drive. So, first check if your hard drive has sufficient storage space to save the file. If this is not the case, then it might happen that your antivirus program is interrupting the saving process. To check this, temporarily disable your antivirus program and then try to save the file. If still your Excel is throwing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error, then follow the below given methods to fix the error:

###  **Method 1: Open the Excel in Safe Mode and Disable the Add-ins**

When you open Excel in safe mode, it opens without the third-party add-ins. This helps in finding out if any add-ins are causing the error.

 Here’s how to open the Excel in safe mode:

- Open the Run window by pressing **Windows key + R**.
- Type **excel /safe** in the Run window.  

    ![Excel Save Mode Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/excel-save-mode-command.jpg)?

- Next, click on **OK**.
- It will open Excel in safe mode.
- Now, try to open and save the affected file.

If you are able to save the file without any issue, then this means that the error has occurred due to third-party add-ins or settings. You can try disabling the add-ins to fix the issue. To do this, follow these steps:

- First, open Excel.
- Then, go to the **File** tab and click **Options**.

![Go To Options Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/go-to-options-window.jpg)

    ![Add-ins Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/add-ins-window.jpg)

**_Note_**_: Disabling add-ins does not remove them from the system. To remove them permanently, you need to uninstall them._

### **Method 2: Check the Excel File Name**

Some users have observed this error when saving the Excel file with an invalid name. You can check the file name and ensure that it should not contain more than 218 characters. If the name exceeds the required limit, then try shortening the file name or move the file to a folder with a short path name.

###  **Method 3: Copy the Data from the Affected File to a New File**

If you are not able to save the Excel document, then try copying the data from the affected file to a new Excel file. Then, save the new file with a different name. This helps in resolving the issue.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide File Permissions**

You may experience the “Errors were detected while saving Excel" issue when you do not have desired permissions to modify the folder in which your Excel file is located. To modify the folder, you should have read, write, and create permissions. You can check and provide the desired permissions using the below steps:

- Navigate to the Windows **Program Files** and then find the desired folder (where the Excel file is saved).
- Right-click on the folder and then choose **Properties**.
- Select the **Security** tab and then click
- Click on **Change Permissions** in the **Advanced Settings**
- Click **Administrators** and then click **Edit**.
- Now set the **Apply to drop-down** button to **This Folder, Subfolder, and Files**.
- Click on the **Full Control** field and then click **Apply > OK**.

###  **Method 5: Check Pivot Tables in Excel Sheet**

You can review Pivot tables to see if they are causing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error. To do so, follow the below steps:

- Click **Power Pivot > Manage**.  

    ![Check Pivot Table In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/check-pivot-table-in-excel.jpg)

- Check the tabs in the **Power Pivot**
- Check if all the formulas used in the table are correct. Sometimes, even a small typo can create an issue in Excel.

### **Method 6: Repair Your Excel File**

The “Errors were detected while saving Excel” issue can also occur if the Excel file is corrupted. In such a case, you can take the help of the built-in utility in Excel – Open and Repair to repair your Excel file. Here’s how to use the tool:

- In Excel, click the **File** tab and then click **Open**.
- Click **Browse** to select the desired file.
- The Open dialog box is displayed. Click on the corrupted file.

    ![Message Appear After Repair](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/message-appear-after-repair.jpg)

- Click **Close**.

 However, sometimes, the Open and Repair utility fails to fix the file if it is severely corrupted or large-sized.
