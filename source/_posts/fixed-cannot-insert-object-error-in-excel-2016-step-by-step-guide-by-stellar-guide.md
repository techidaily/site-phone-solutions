Many users have reported encountering the “cannot insert object” error while adding/embedding objects into the Excel file. It usually occurs when using Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to add content (PDF, Microsoft documents) from external applications to worksheet. The error can also occur when using ActiveX control in Excel. Below, we’ll explain why you cannot insert object into Excel sheet and how to troubleshoot the issue.

## **Why the “Cannot Insert Object” Error Occurs?**

- Macro Settings can prevent the insertion of objects into a workbook.
- The Excel file in which you are trying to add an element is corrupted.
- The object (you are inserting into the workbook) is damaged.
- Object size limitations.
- System’s insufficient memory might prevent new objects’ addition.
- Incompatible Excel file format.
- Add-ins controls are disabled.
- Incompatible or faulty Add-ins.
- Issue with Security Settings.

## **Methods to Fix the “Cannot Insert Object” Error in Excel**

You may encounter the “Cannot insert object” error when trying to add an element stored on a network. It can occur due to issues with the file link, such as incorrect file location. In such a case, you can check the link by selecting the **link to file** option from the **Insert** tab.

Sometimes, the error can occur if the file in which you are trying to insert the object is locked and password-protected. In this case, you can [unprotect the Excel file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6). If the issue still persists, then you can follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Check and Change Restricted Security Settings

Excel provides security settings to protect your workbook. Sometimes, these settings can prevent inserting objects in the file. You can change the security settings to allow Excel to insert objects. To do so, follow these steps:

- Open your Excel application.
- Locate the **File** and then click **Options**.
- In **Excel Options**, click **Trust Center**.

- Restart Excel to apply the changes.

### **Method 2: Uninstall Microsoft Office Updates**

You can also encounter the “Cannot insert object” error in Excel after installing MS Office updates. It might be due to the issues with the installed updates. To fix this, you can uninstall the recently installed Office updates. To uninstall the Office updates, follow these steps:

- Search for “**View Installed Updates**” and click on the desired Office updates.

- Press **CTRL + ALT + DEL** on the keyboard and click **Task Manager**.
- Click on the **Processes** tab and search for any unnecessary processes.
- Right-click on the process and then select **End Task**.
- Restart Excel to see if the issue is fixed.

### **Method 4: Check Excel File Size**

If your Excel file size exceeds the prescribed limit, it can also lead to the “Cannot insert Excel object” error. So, check the Excel file size. You can reduce the file size by removing unnecessary objects, such as formulas or images.

### **Method 5: Check and Change Excel ActiveX Settings**

You can get the “Excel cannot insert object” error if your Excel file contains macros, controls, and other interactive buttons. It usually occurs if the ActiveX Controls option is disabled. You can check and change the ActiveX Settings to fix the issue. Here are the steps:

- Open your Excel application.
- Navigate to **File** and then click **Options**.
- In **Excel Options**, click the **Trust Center** tab.
- In the **Trust Center Settings**, click **ActiveX Settings**.
- Under ActiveX Settings, make sure the “Enable all controls without restrictions and without prompting” option is selected.

- If the option is not selected, then select it and click **OK**.
- Restart the Excel and check if the error is fixed or not.

### **Method 6: Repair the Excel Workbook**

The “Cannot insert object” error can occur if the object you are trying to insert is corrupted or the file in which you are inserting the object is damaged.
