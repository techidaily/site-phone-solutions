## Fix the Too many different cell formats Error in Excel?

Excel has set a limit on the number of unique cell formats within a workbook. Excel 2003 allows up to 4000 different cell format combinations, whereas Excel 2007 and later versions allow a maximum of 64000 combinations. When this limit exceeds, you may encounter errors, such as “Too many different cell formats”. It can prevent you from inserting or modifying workbook rows or columns. Sometimes, it prevents you to copy and paste the content within the same or different workbooks.  This error may also occur due to various other reasons.

You can encounter the “Too many different cell formats” error due to the below reasons:

- Formatting is missing in the workbook.
- Size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive use of complex formatting (conditional formatting).
- Workbook contains a large number of merged cells.
- There are multiple built-in or custom cell styles.
- Excel workbook is corrupted.
- The unused styles are unexpectedly copied to new workbooks (when moving or copying a worksheet from one to another).
- Workbooks contain multiple worksheets with different cell formatting.

## **Methods to Fix the “Too many different cell formats” Error in Excel**

First, check that your Excel application is up-to-date. It helps in preventing duplicate styles in workbooks. If the error persists, then follow the below methods:

### **Method 1: Simplify the Workbook Formatting**

You can face the error in Excel - Too many different cell formats, if the size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive or unnecessary formatting. You can try to simplify the formatting of the affected workbook. While reducing the number of formatting combinations, you can follow the simplifying guidelines, such as using a standard font and applying borders consistently. Follow the below steps to remove unnecessary formatting in your worksheet:

- First, open the affected worksheet.
- Now, use the shortcut key (Ctrl+A) to select all the cells.
- In the Excel ribbon, navigate to the **Home** tab and click **Clear**.

![Clicking Clear in the Home tab of the Excel ribbon](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-excel-home-click-clear.jpg)

- Then, select the **Clear Formats** option.

![Choosing Clear Formats from the available options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/select-clear-formats-option.jpg)

The above steps will remove all unnecessary formatting from the selected cells, thus reducing the number of cell formats. Besides this, you can try removing the cell patterns (if any) or [use cell styles](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/apply-create-or-remove-a-cell-style-472213bf-66bd-40c8-815c-594f0f90cd22) to remove unnecessary formatting in the workbook.

### **Method 2: Remove Conditional Formatting**

Conditional formatting is also one of the reasons behind the “Too many different cell formats” error. It usually occurs if you have applied multiple rules to various cells or cell ranges within a workbook. Each rule has its own formatting settings.

Here are the steps to do this:

- Open the Excel file in which you are getting the error.
- Go to the **Home** tab and locate **Conditional Formatting**.

![Finding Conditional Formatting in the Home tab](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-home-and-then-conditional-formatting.jpg)

## Resolve Compile Error in Hidden Module in Excel: Causes & Solutions

The hidden module in Excel refers to a container with VBA codes, custom queries, and complex macros. The compile error in a hidden (protected) module in the Excel worksheet usually occurs when doing different activities on a macro-enabled sheet, such as merging .xls files. The error can result in macros execution failure. You need to quickly resolve this compile error to restore full functionality of the VBA code. Below, we’ll be discussing the solutions to fix this Excel error. But before that, let’s see why this error occurs.

You may encounter the Compile error in hidden module due to one of the following reasons:

- The code in the workbook is not compatible with the Excel application.
- Manual queries created in a previous version are no longer compatible with your current version of Excel.
- Missing references.
- Invalid .exe files (control information cache files) are automatically created with ActiveX control insertion in Excel file.
- Protected module is corrupted.
- The workbook with hidden module is damaged or corrupted.
- Incompatible add-ins.
- Incompatible Excel file version.
- The module is protected or password-protected.
- Missing or corrupted mscomctl.ocx file.

Excel can throw the compile error while compiling the code that exists in the protected module. So, first check the error and identify the hidden module that is creating the issue. You can unprotect the module. Also, ensure that you have permission to access the VBA code in the module. If the error still exists, follow the below troubleshooting methods.

### Method 1: Re-register ActiveX Control Files or mscomctl.ocx Files

You can get the compile error in the Excel file, containing the VBA code related to ActiveX controls or OCX files. The ActiveX control files and OCX files (mscomctl.ocx files) are the components of Microsoft’s standard controls library. The compile error in the hidden module can occur if these files are missing. In this case, you can use the Regsvr32 tool to re-register the OCX files. The [Regsvr32](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/how-to-use-the-regsvr32-tool-and-troubleshoot-regsvr32-error-messages-a98d960a-7392-e6fe-d90a-3f4e0cb543e5) is a command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls in the Windows registry.

### Method 2: Delete .exd Files

 The .exd files are temporary files created by Excel when inserting ActiveX controls objects. These temporary files can lead to a compile error if they are corrupted. So, if this issue has occurred, particularly in the Excel file containing ActiveX controls, then deleting .exd files might fix the issue. To delete the .exd file, follow the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window by pressing the Windows+R keys.

![Open The Run Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/open-the-run-window.jpg)

- In the **Run** window, type **%appdata%**.

![Type App Data Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/type-app-data-command.jpg)

- In the **Roaming** window, click on the **Microsoft** option.

![Click On Microsoft Option Under Roaming](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-on-microsoft-option-under-roaming.jpg)

- Under **Microsoft**, you will see a list of folders. Search and click on **Forms.**
- Right-click on a file with .exd extension and select **Delete**.
- Once you delete the .exd files, restart your Excel application.

### Method 3: Rollback the Office Updates

MS Office updates or upgrades may also cause the compile error in hidden module in Excel. If the error has occurred after downloading the recent Microsoft Office updates, try [reverting to the previous version](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2bd5c457-a917-d57e-35a1-f709e3dda841) or uninstalling the recent updates to fix the issue.

### Method 4: Unselect Missing References

The compile error in hidden module determine path in Excel can also occur if your file contains a reference to object library/type library, which is labelled as Missing. You can locate, check, and uncheck the references marked as ‘Missing’ to fix the issue. Here are the steps:

- Open your **Excel** and press **Alt + F11** keys.
- The **Visual Basic Editor** is displayed.

![Visual Basic Editor](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/visual-basic-editor.jpg)

- Go to the **Tools** option and then click **References**.

![Click On References Under Tools Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-on-references-under-tools-option.jpg)

- In the **References-VBAProject** window, under **Available References**, search and unselect the references starting as “Missing”.

![Unselect Missing References](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unselect-missing-references.jpg)

- Click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the Code in Module

The compile error in hidden module can occur if there are issues in the code within the module. The problems include incorrect or missing syntaxes, missing parameters/references, or the code contains incompatible functions or a wrong name of the object. You can check and fix these issues in the code by opening the VBA editor.

### Method 6: Check and Remove Add-ins

In Excel, the compile error in macro-enabled files can also occur due to incompatible add-ins. You can check and disable the **add-ins** in Excel using the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window and type excel /safe and then click **OK**. The Excel application will open in safe mode.
- Now try to open the affected Excel file. If it opens without the error, then check and remove the latest installed Excel add-ins.
- Navigate to the **File** option and then select **Options**.
- In the **Excel Options** window, click **Add-ins**.

![Click Addins Select Latest Addins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-add-ins-select-latest-add-ins.jpg)

- Under **Add-ins**, search and select the latest add-ins, and then click on **Go**.
- In the **Add-ins** window, uncheck the add-ins and then click **OK**.

![Select  Analysis Toolpak](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/select-analysis-toolpak.jpg)

- Restart Excel and then check if the error is fixed or not.

### Method 7: Repair the Corrupt Excel File

![Cannot open the specified file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-main-error.png)

## Causes of ‘hyperlinks not working in Excel’ problem, and solutions thereof

Here are some of the possible causes behind the ‘hyperlinks not working’ issue and solutions to fix it:

### Cause 1 – Change in the name of the hyperlinked file

If the file name that appears in the hyperlink text is different than the actual file name, it will prevent the hyperlink from working.

#### Solution – Link to the renamed file

Ensure that the links in the Excel file are updated and points to the renamed file. For this, right-click the hyperlink and select ‘Edit the hyperlink’. Next, in the hyperlink address, replace the current filename with the renamed one in the hyperlink address.

### Cause 2 – File name has a pound (#) sign

When you create a hyperlink for a file in Excel, you cannot use a pound character (#) in the file name that appears in the hyperlink. That is because the pound sign is not accepted in hyperlinks and may lead to the ‘Cannot open the specified file’ error.

**Note:** While you can use a pound character in a file name, it cannot be used in hyperlinks in an MS Office document.  

#### Solution – Rename the file name and remove the pound sign

Open the file that contains the ‘#’ sign and rename it by following these steps.

- Right-click the cell containing the hyperlink that is not working, and click **Edit Hyperlink**.
- From the **Address** box, copy the address of the file you are linking to.
- Go to the location where the file is stored, right-click on the file, and click **Rename**.
- Remove the ‘#’ character from the name of the file.
- Go back to the Excel file, right-click on the problematic hyperlink, and choose **Edit Hyperlink**. Next, browse and select the renamed file.
- The renamed file without the pound sign will be added in the **Address** box.
- Click **OK**.

Now try opening the hyperlink.

### Cause 3 – Sudden system shutdown causes abrupt closing of Excel

There may be a discrepancy in the data in hyperlinks when a system shut down suddenly, without properly closing the Excel file. And so, when trying to open a link, it won’t open.

#### Solution – Enable the option to save hyperlinks

There is an inbuilt option in Excel to update hyperlinks every time the workbook is saved. Follow these steps to enable that option:

**Note:** The steps may vary based on the Excel version you are using.

For Excel 2013, 2016, or 2019:

- Open Excel Workbook -> Go to **File**\->**Options**\->**Advanced**
- Scroll down to find the General tab and click on **Web Options**
- Web Options Window pops-up
- In the Web Options Window, go to **Files** Tab and select the ‘**Update Links on save**‘ checkbox
- Click on **OK** button and your option is saved

The steps are also explained in the image below:

![Select Update links on Save in Web Options window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Uncheck-the-option-to-save-Hyperlinks.jpg)

For Excel 2007:

- Click the **Office** button

If this is not the issue, then follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Review VBA Code

The exception from hresult 0x800a03ec excel can occur if you are trying to execute incorrect or incomplete queries in the Excel VBA code. It can also appear if the formulas do not contain the equal (=) symbol at the beginning. Verify the VBA code for any logical flaws, typo errors, syntax errors, or missing references.

### Method 2: Check the Field Size

Excel has certain [limits and specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). If the Excel file’s data exceeds these designated size limits, you can get the MS Excel error code 0x800A03EC error. For example, this error occurs if you try to export a file with more rows than the limit of 65536 and columns than the limit of 256. Check and optimize the file size by minimizing complex formulas and other objects.

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

Sometimes, disabled items in Add-ins settings can prevent macros from functioning correctly. You can check and enable the disabled items in Add-ins using these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Options**.

![Go To Options Tab](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-options-tab.jpg)

## How to fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid error in Excel?

The Pivot Table field name is not valid error can occur while creating, modifying, or refreshing data fields in the pivot table. It can also appear when using VBA code to modify the pivot table. It usually occurs when there is an issue with the field name in a code or if there is a hidden or empty column in the pivot table. However, there could be many other reasons behind this error.

## Why the "Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid" Error Occurs?

You can get the "Pivot Table field name not valid" error in Excel due to several reasons. Some possible causes are:

- Excel file is corrupted
- Damaged fields in the pivot table
- Pivot table is corrupted/damaged
- Hidden columns in the pivot table
- Macro (referring to the pivot table) is corrupted
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Missing or incorrect fields in the VBA code
- Issue with workbook.RefreshAll method syntax (if using)
- Pivot Table contains empty columns
- Header values or header column is missing in the Pivot Table
- Pivot table is created without headers
- Columns/rows are deleted from the Pivot Table

## Methods to Fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid Error in Excel

You can get this error if you have selected the complete data sheet and then trying to create the Pivot Table. Make sure you choose only the data fields that you want to insert in the Pivot Table. If this is not the case, then follow the troubleshooting methods mentioned below.

### **Method 1: Check the Header Value in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot table field name is not valid" error can occur if you have not set up the pivot table correctly. All the columns having data in them should have header and header values. A pivot table without a header value can create issues. You can check the header and its value from the Formula bar. Change the header if the header value is too lengthy or if it contains special characters.

![Adding reference for the document with details.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/headers-value-in-formula-bars.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Change the Data Range in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" can occur while modifying a field in Pivot Table. It usually occurs if you're trying to add or modify the field by selecting an incorrect data range in the **Create PivotTable** dialog box. The **"Create PivotTable**" feature helps define how data would be displayed within the pivot table.

Let's take a scenario to understand this. Open the Excel file with PivotTable. Click on the fields (you want to add), go to the **Insert** option, and click **PivotTable.**  

![Inserting a Pivot Table from selection](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-insert-and-then-pivot-option.jpg)

If you select an incorrect range, i.e. A1:E18, instead of correct range - "Expenses**!$A$3:Expenses!$A$4**," you will immediately get the error message.

![Selecting a table range with values for report](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-table-with-correct-range.jpg)

So, type the correct range under the Select a table or range option and click **OK**.

### **Method 3: Unhide Excel Columns/Rows**

The error can also occur if some columns/rows of the Pivot Table's data source are hidden. When you try to add a hidden column as a field in the PivotTable, the Excel application will fail to read the data of the hidden column. You can check and unhide the Excel columns by following these steps:

- Open the Excel file.
- Locate the hidden column number.
- Move your cursor on the hidden column number and right-click on the space between the columns. Click **Unhide**.  

    ![unhiding the rows in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-unhide-option.jpg)

### **Method 4: Check and Delete Empty Excel Columns**

Sometimes, you can get the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error if you are trying to use an empty column as a field in your Pivot Table. Check the columns with no values in all cells. If found, then delete the empty columns. This method is ideal for small-size Excel files. However, for large-sized files, it is a time-consuming process.

### **Method 5: Unmerge the Column Header (If Merged)**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error can also occur due to merged column headers. The pivot table references headers to identify the data inside the rows or columns. The merged headers can sometimes create data inconsistencies. You can try unmerging the column headers to fix the issue. Follow these steps:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Home**
- Click the **Merge & Center** option and select **Unmerge Cells** from the dropdown.  

    ![unmerging cells from home tab in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-home-select-unmergecells.jpg)

### **Method 6: Disable the Background Refresh Option**

If the "background refresh" option in the Excel file is enabled, it may also create issues with Pivot Table. The Excel updates all the pivot tables in the background even after a small change if the background refresh option is enabled. This may create issues if the Excel file is large with too many tables. You can try turning off the "background refresh" option in the Excel file to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Data** tab and then click **Connections**.  

    ![Adding connections from the data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/go-to-data-then-click-connections.jpg)

- In the **Workbook Connections**dialog box, click on the **'Add'** dropdown to add the workbook (in which you need to modify the refresh settings).  

    ![Add the option for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-add-from-drop-down.jpg)

- Once you have chosen the Excel file, click **Properties.**  

    ![Selecting Properties for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-properties-on-workbook-connections.jpg)

- In the **Connection Properties** window, unselect the **"Enable background refresh"**option, select the "**Refresh data when opening the file**", and click **OK.  

    ![Enabling the connection properties by enabling and refreshing data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-background-refresh-and-refresh-data-option.jpg)

    **

### **Method 7: Check the VBA Code**

The error can also occur when working with PivotTable using VBA code in Excel. Some Excel users reported this error on forums as **run-time error 1004: The PivotTable field name is not valid**. This error usually occurs when there are issues in the VBA code, affecting the PivotTable data source or field references. You can check field names referring to PivotTable or Workbook.RefreshAll function syntax and other errors in the code.

### **Method 8: Repair your Excel File**

One of the reasons behind the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error is corruption in the Excel file, containing the Pivot Table. You can repair your Excel file using Microsoft built-in utility - Open and Repair. Here's how to use this utility:

- In Excel, navigate to **File > Open.**
- Click **Browse** to choose the affected workbook.
- The **Open** dialog box will appear. Click on the corrupted file.
- Click the arrow next to the **Open**button and then select **Open and Repair**.
- You will see a dialog box with three buttons - **Repair, Extract Data,** and **Cancel**.

- Click on the **Repair** button to recover as much of the data as possible.
- After repair, a message is displayed. Click **Close**.

###  **Method 9: Use a Professional Excel Repair Tool**
