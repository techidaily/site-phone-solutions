In such cases, you are left with the option to repair the damaged or corrupt Excel file with the help of an Excel repair software, such as [Stellar Repair for Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## Solutions to Restore Excel File

Below we have discussed various solutions to repair, recover, and restore unsaved, lost, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel files with the help of MS Excel options and Excel repair software.

**_NOTE:_** _Some of these methods work only if you had enabled or configured certain required settings or options before corruption or losing the Excel file._

### 1\. Restore Lost or Unsaved Excel File via ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks’ Option

The _Recover Unsaved Workbooks_ option allows you to restore the Excel file that you forgot to save before closing MS Excel or it stopped working. The steps are as follows:

- Navigate to ‘_File > Open._’
- Scroll to the bottom and click on ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks.’ This opens a File Explorer browser window.

![recover unsaved excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/recover-unsaved-document.png)

- Now look for the Excel file that you lost and then double-click on it to open and restore the Excel file.
- Once the file is open, click on **File > Save As** and save it to your desired location.

However, this option works only if you had enabled and set up the ‘_Save AutoRecover information every X minutes_’ option and enabled the ‘_Keep the last AutoRecovered version if I close without saving’_ option.  

![change excel settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/change-settings-excel.png)

Also, this may not restore the most recent copy of your Excel file, but it will surely save your time that went into creating and editing the workbook.

### 2\. Repair and Restore Corrupt or Inaccessible Excel File

If the Excel file you are trying to open or access is corrupt, MS Excel will display an error message. When MS Excel detects corruption, it starts ‘File Recovery Mode’ to repair the Excel workbook.

However, if it doesn’t start automatically, you can manually repair minor corruption error and restore the Excel file by following these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Open** and then navigate to the corrupt or damaged Excel file location.
- Select the file and then click on the arrow beside the ‘**Open**’ button to choose the **‘Open and Repair…**’ option.

![open and repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/open-and-repair-excel-file.png)

- Now click ‘**Repair’** if you want to recover maximum data from a corrupt or inaccessible Excel workbook and restore it to a new Excel file.

![repair corrupt excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repair-corrupt-excel-sheet.png)

If the ‘**Repair’** option fails, use the Extract Data option that extracts values, data, and formulas from the Excel workbook.

### 3\. Revert Excel File to Last Saved Version

When an Excel file gets corrupt or damaged while working, you may revert the Excel file to the last saved version. This allows you to restore the Excel file version that isn’t corrupt or damaged. The steps are as follows,

- Click File > Open.
- Double-click the name of the workbook that you have opened in Excel.
- Click Yes to reopen the workbook.

The workbook opens without any changes you’ve made that might have caused the workbook to become corrupted.

### 4\. Use Excel Repair Software to Restore Excel File

If the corrupt or damaged Excel file isn’t repaired by using MS Excel options or you lost data after restoring the unsaved version or after reverting to the last version, you can rely on an Excel repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel.

The software repairs Excel files with 100% integrity and restores the Excel data, such as table, Pivot tables, charts, etc., while preserving the workbook properties and formatting.

## 'Unable to Save Excel Workbook' Issue [Fix 2024]

**Summary:** You may unable to save your Excel Workbooks due to several reasons. Many users have reported this issue on the Tech Forums. This blog will discuss a few instances when users cannot save their Excel files. It lists the causes behind the issue and their possible solutions. It also mentions the Stellar Repair for Excel to fix the saving error if it is due to corruption in the Excel file.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

It is easy to work with Microsoft Excel but sometimes, the application may create issues thereby hampering the smooth functioning of the workbook. One such issue is “unable to Save Excel Workbook”.

## Let’s take a look at the issue of Unable to Save Excel Workbook

### **Instance 1:**

In an organization, users connected to one of the servers (Windows 2008 R2) using Citrix – a Terminal Server configured with Windows 2008 R2 –and accessed their data through a File Server, also configured with Windows 2008R2. Since the connectivity to Shared Drive was established through a Terminal server, any conflict amongst the server configuration may create conflict in shared file.

This issue was discussed at length at one of the [Tech Forums](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/371563-excel-document-not-saved-issue), where the users were unable to access their workbooks stored on the shared drive. The File menu did not work. As a result, the users were forced to save the workbook by creating quick access shortcuts or locally on the desktop. In many cases, the saving option was ruled out completely.

### **Instance 2:**

A [similar problem](https://www.dell.com/support/article/in/en/indhs1/sln308103/unable-to-save-workbook-in-microsoft-excel?lang=en) was reported, wherein the users received an error when saving an Excel workbook after inserting a chart in an existing workbook (previously saved) or copying values from an existing workbook. A system is configured with Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 10 configuration. The issue arises when the user is unable to save the changes after editing in a saved spreadsheet. The following message displays on the screen:

![Image of Error message while trying to save excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Excel-Error.png)

Figure: Unable to Save Excel WorkBook Issue

**Further, if the user clicks ‘Continue’, the following error message is received:**

“Excel encountered errors during save. However, Excel was able to minimally save your file to <**filename.xlsx**\>”.

**Note:** This issue impacts build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later, and also only occurs with files that are stored locally, such as on the desktop. This problem does not occur if you manually enter values or insert a chart in a newly created workbook.

## Plausible reasons for the ‘Unable to save Excel workbook’ Issue

1. The issue was detected in Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 32-bit, Service Pack 14.0.6029.1000.
2. Excel version on the user system may or may not match with Excel version on File server.
3. The issue of ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ impacts only the Build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later.
4. In case of Issue 2, the problem surfaces when the user adds files, tables or charts in the locally saved excel files, such as on the desktop.

## Methods to fix the ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ Issue

There may be an issue with the Build version or the Registry Values settings may not be appropriate, which does not allow the Excel workbooks to save.

**But, before starting to resolve the issue, verify the following:**

1. **The location where the file is to be saved may not have enough space to save the Excel file**: Check the available space and save again. You may also use the option of ‘Save As’ to save the file at a new location.
2. **Excel file may be a shared one where edits are not allowed by a specific user**: There are restrictions attached to documents and other files shared over the network. Check for these restrictions.
3. **Antivirus may interrupt in during file saving**: Antivirus in the system may not allow saving of the files. Request the system administrator to uninstall the antivirus and reinstall after saving.
4. **The file is not saved within 218 characters**: If the file is not saved due to the naming issue, then check the character length and try again.
5. **Differences in Windows versions** of the local system and those on network drive may cause excel not saved issues. Check that all the systems have the same configuration and are updated to the recently available versions.
6. **Excel spreadsheet is corrupt**: If none of the above factors have not caused hindrance in saving the file, then there may be a probability of [corruption in the Excel spreadsheet](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/simple-way-to-open-corrupt-excel-file-without-any-backup/).

Once verified, look for a healthy and restorable backup. If backup is missing, resolve the issue of “Unable to open Excel File” with manual settings on local system or through a reliable Excel repair software.

2. Check if all the formulae are active and working.
3. Make changes to the Google Sheet and verify that all the changes are working fine.
4. Use the Google Sheets export feature to download the file in Excel format.

1. Open a blank Excel File. Go to **File** and Click **Open**.
2. Go to **Computers** and click **Browse**.
3. Access the **Location and Folder** and click the arrow icon beside **Open** followed by **Open and Repair.**

Figure: Illustrates Steps to use ‘Open and Repair’ method

The Open and Repair utility is not competitive enough and may not fix corruption in severely corrupted files. Hence, if you are unable to save Excel workbook after applying the manual methods, then you can search for a useful software-based repair utility.

The **Excel repair software** takes care to save the repaired data in a new file to minimize the chances of further corruption.

## **Conclusion**

‘Unable to save Excel file’ is a generic problem that may appear due to various reasons. In this blog post, we presented some of the actual instances reported by users on community forums.

Windows updates, the Build versions, the Service Packs of the local systems and those on the network drive must be either similar or in sync with each other. Any deviation may cause issues in accessing or saving the Microsoft files, as reported in Instance 1 is caused where user is unable to save Microsoft Excel file on the Network Drive. In case, the user is unable to save the file on network drive then the problem lies with the Registry value.

Another case is when the users receive an error while saving an Excel workbook after they insert a chart in an existing workbook or copying values from an existing workbook. This issue is known to affect build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later, and only occurs with locally stored files.

When a user is unable to save a specific Excel file, then the problem can be resolved using the manual methods or the software based utility. The mode of repair depends upon the level of corruption in Excel file.

Hence, it is suggested to analyze the nature of the problem and decide an appropriate resolution method.


## How to fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid error in Excel?

The Pivot Table field name is not valid error can occur while creating, modifying, or refreshing data fields in the pivot table. It can also appear when using VBA code to modify the pivot table. It usually occurs when there is an issue with the field name in a code or if there is a hidden or empty column in the pivot table. However, there could be many other reasons behind this error.

## Why the "Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid" Error Occurs?

You can get the "Pivot Table field name not valid" error in Excel due to several reasons. Some possible causes are:

- Excel file is corrupted
- Damaged fields in the pivot table
- Pivot table is corrupted/damaged
- Hidden columns in the pivot table
- Macro (referring to the pivot table) is corrupted
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Missing or incorrect fields in the VBA code
- Issue with workbook.RefreshAll method syntax (if using)
- Pivot Table contains empty columns
- Header values or header column is missing in the Pivot Table
- Pivot table is created without headers
- Columns/rows are deleted from the Pivot Table

## Methods to Fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid Error in Excel

You can get this error if you have selected the complete data sheet and then trying to create the Pivot Table. Make sure you choose only the data fields that you want to insert in the Pivot Table. If this is not the case, then follow the troubleshooting methods mentioned below.

### **Method 1: Check the Header Value in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot table field name is not valid" error can occur if you have not set up the pivot table correctly. All the columns having data in them should have header and header values. A pivot table without a header value can create issues. You can check the header and its value from the Formula bar. Change the header if the header value is too lengthy or if it contains special characters.

![Adding reference for the document with details.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/headers-value-in-formula-bars.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Change the Data Range in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" can occur while modifying a field in Pivot Table. It usually occurs if you're trying to add or modify the field by selecting an incorrect data range in the **Create PivotTable** dialog box. The **"Create PivotTable**" feature helps define how data would be displayed within the pivot table.

Let's take a scenario to understand this. Open the Excel file with PivotTable. Click on the fields (you want to add), go to the **Insert** option, and click **PivotTable.**  

![Inserting a Pivot Table from selection](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-insert-and-then-pivot-option.jpg)

If you select an incorrect range, i.e. A1:E18, instead of correct range - "Expenses**!$A$3:Expenses!$A$4**," you will immediately get the error message.

![Selecting a table range with values for report](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-table-with-correct-range.jpg)

So, type the correct range under the Select a table or range option and click **OK**.

### **Method 3: Unhide Excel Columns/Rows**

The error can also occur if some columns/rows of the Pivot Table's data source are hidden. When you try to add a hidden column as a field in the PivotTable, the Excel application will fail to read the data of the hidden column. You can check and unhide the Excel columns by following these steps:

- Open the Excel file.
- Locate the hidden column number.
- Move your cursor on the hidden column number and right-click on the space between the columns. Click **Unhide**.  

    ![unhiding the rows in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-unhide-option.jpg)

### **Method 4: Check and Delete Empty Excel Columns**

Sometimes, you can get the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error if you are trying to use an empty column as a field in your Pivot Table. Check the columns with no values in all cells. If found, then delete the empty columns. This method is ideal for small-size Excel files. However, for large-sized files, it is a time-consuming process.

### **Method 5: Unmerge the Column Header (If Merged)**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error can also occur due to merged column headers. The pivot table references headers to identify the data inside the rows or columns. The merged headers can sometimes create data inconsistencies. You can try unmerging the column headers to fix the issue. Follow these steps:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Home**
- Click the **Merge & Center** option and select **Unmerge Cells** from the dropdown.  

    ![unmerging cells from home tab in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-home-select-unmergecells.jpg)

### **Method 6: Disable the Background Refresh Option**

If the "background refresh" option in the Excel file is enabled, it may also create issues with Pivot Table. The Excel updates all the pivot tables in the background even after a small change if the background refresh option is enabled. This may create issues if the Excel file is large with too many tables. You can try turning off the "background refresh" option in the Excel file to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

## Data Disappears in Excel - How to get it back

**Summary:** You may face the issue of ‘Excel spreadsheet data disappeared’ after changing Excel file properties and formatting rows and columns. This blog discusses the possible reasons for data disappearance and the solutions to fix the issue. Also, it mentions an Excel file repair tool to retrieve the data from the file. Sometimes, while editing or formatting a cell in an Excel spreadsheet, the data may go missing or disappear. Let’s discuss in detail the reasons that may cause the ‘Excel data disappeared’ issue along with the solutions.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

## **Probable Reasons for Data Disappearing in MS Excel and Solutions Thereof**

### Reason 1 – Unsaved Data

While entering data in an Excel spreadsheet, it is important to save the data at frequent intervals. Doing so prevents any unsaved data from disappearing if you lose power or accidentally click ‘No’ when prompted to save the file. Unfortunately, such a situation is quite common as users often close the file without saving the recently made changes to a spreadsheet.

### Solution – Use the ‘AutoSave’ Feature

With the AutoSave feature enabled in Excel, data won’t be lost in the event of power failure or abruptly closing the Excel program. By default, Excel automatically saves the information in a spreadsheet after every 10 minutes. You can reduce the limit to a few seconds to reduce the chances of Excel file data lost after being saved.

![Change excel autosave internal](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/change-excel-autosave-interval-img-1-1.png)

### Reason 2 – Changing Excel Format

You can save an Excel file in various formats, like spreadsheet, text, webpage, and more. However, at times, saving the spreadsheet in a different format may lead to missing data. For example, when you save a workbook to a text file format, all formulas and calculations applied to the data will be lost.

### Solution – Adjust a Spreadsheet for the Changed Format 

If you’re changing the format of a spreadsheet, make space for the rows and columns. Also, remove all calculations before saving the file.

**Note:** If the sheet is shared on multiple computers, then save the file in compatibility mode.

### Reason 3 – Merging Cells

You can combine two or more cells data to make one large cell. This technique is primarily used to fit the text of a title in a sheet. If there is data in two or more cells, then only the data in the top-left cell is displayed and the data in all other cells is deleted. If the other merged cells have been populated with data after merging, the data is not featured and it does not appear even after remerging the cells.

### Solution – Merge Cells inside One Column

To merge cells without data loss, combine all the cells you want to merge within a column and do the following:

-   Select the cells to be combined.
-   Ensure that column width is wide enough to fit the contents of a cell.
-   In the spreadsheet, under the Editing group, click ‘Fill,’ and then click ‘Justify.’

![excel-fill-option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/excel-fill-option-img-2-1-1024x253.png)

-   Under Alignment, click on the ‘Merge & Center’ option to center align the text. Or, click on ‘Merge Cells’.

**Note:** This solution works for text only. You cannot use it to merge formulas or any numerical values. If you need to combine two or more cells with formula into a single cell, try using the [Excel CONCAT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/combine-text-from-two-or-more-cells-into-one-cell-81ba0946-ce78-42ed-b3c3-21340eb164a6).

### Reason 4 – Cell Formatting

Cells and text in the cells can be displayed in different colors to make the spreadsheet simple to create and infer. You may experience data loss when you try to modify the data or change the color or size of the data. Though the information may exist, the data may show an error due to the following reasons:  

-   White-colored text will not show in a white-colored cell
-   Large font-sized data may not appear in small-sized cell
-   Calculations may show (#VALUE) error after cell-formatting

### Solution – Check and Clear Formatting

Make sure to use dark-colored text on a white-colored cell. Also, resize the cell to fit the text size. Check if numbers in a cell are entered as text. If so, you need to apply a number format to the text-formatted numbers. Read more about it, from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/fix-text-formatted-numbers-by-applying-a-number-format-6599c03a-954d-4d83-b78a-23af2c8845d0).

## What Else You Can Do to Resolve the ‘Excel Data Disappeared’ Issue?

If you can’t recover the missing Excel file data, try to repair or extract the data from the file using the built-in **Excel repair tool**. Follow the below steps to use the tool:

-   Open MS Excel, click File > Open > Computer > Browse.

## How to Repair Corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel File?

**Summary:** If you are not able to perform any action on the Pivot Table of MS Excel file, it indicates Excel Pivot Table corruption. In such a case, you must repair the corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel file by using an Excel repair software or manual troubleshooting steps discussed in this post.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

MS Excel is equipped with several brilliant features and functions which make working with large volumes of data easy. In addition to helping users save data into well-organized cells and tables, the application helps users draw inferences from the data. Pivot Table is one such Excel feature that helps users extract the gist from a large number of rowed data. But often, the Pivot table may get corrupted and lead to unexpected errors or data loss.

**Corrupt Pivot Tables** can stop users from reopening previously saved Excel workbooks, raising the serious issue of data inaccessibility. Resolving such issues is an uphill task unless one gets to the actual root cause of the problem.

_However, with Stellar Repair for Excel software, you can **repair the corrupt Pivot table of MS Excel file** while keeping the Excel file data, formatting, layout, etc. intact._

![Repair Corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel File](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-2.jpg)

## **Excel Pivot Tables & Associated Problems**

Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel are created by applying an operation such as sorting, averaging, or summing to the data in certain tables. The results of the operation are saved as summarized data in other tables. Typically, working on the grouping of saved data, Pivot Tables are used in data processing and are found in data visualization programs, such as spreadsheets or business intelligence software.

Put simply, Pivot Tables in Excel allow you to extract the significance or the gist from a large, detailed data set by allowing you to slice-and-dice data, sort-and-filter data, or arrange it in any way you want.

## Frequently Encountered Problems with Pivot Tables in MS Excel

Take a look at the most frequently encountered **Pivot Table issues**:

- You add **new data into a pivot table** but it doesn’t show up when you refresh
- **Pivot Table contains Blanks** instead of Zeros for fields that have no source data
- **Automatic field names assigned** by the Pivot Table can be inappropriate
- It doesn’t directly **show the percentage of total**
- **Grouping** one pivot table affects another
- Your **number of formatting gets lost**
- Refreshing a pivot table **messes up column widths**
- Field headings make no sense and **add clutter**

While some of the above problems seem minute and can easily be resolved using a few tweaks, bigger issues like unexpected Pivot Table error messages that an Excel throws can be troublesome.

## **Pivot Table Errors & Their Reasons**

Excel users who have built new Pivot Tables in Excel often report the following errors when trying to reopen a previously saved workbook:

_**We found a problem with some content in <filename>. Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.**_

![Pivot Table Corruption error in Excel File](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-3.png)

Naturally, users are prompted to click on ‘**Yes**’. But when they do, they get another error message saying:

_**Removed Part: /xl/pivotCache/pivotCacheDefinition1.xml part with XML error**_

_**(PivotTable cache) Load error. Line 2, column 0**_

_**Removed Feature: PivotTable report from /xl/pivotTables/pivotTable1.xml part (PivotTable view)**_

Such errors are indicative of the fact that the **data within the Pivot Table still exists**, but the table itself isn’t functioning anymore.

There could be two primary reasons behind such behavior:

- You’ve **created the Pivot Table in an older version** of Excel but are trying to open-refresh-save it through a newer Excel version
- The **Pivot Table itself is corrupted**

## **How to Repair the Pivot Table Quickly?**

To solve the errors associated with Pivot Tables, you need to repair them. But Microsoft doesn’t offer any inbuilt technique or option to repair Pivot Tables. Thus, to fix the issue, you either need some sort of workaround or an [Excel file repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## **Methods to Fix Corrupt Pivot Table in MS Excel**

Though there aren’t many options to fix the Pivot Table, you can follow these workarounds to try and repair a corrupt Pivot Table of MS Excel. However, before following these steps, create a backup copy of your Excel file.

### **Method 1: Open MS Excel in Safe Mode**

If you can, save all its contents to a new Pivot Table in the latest version of Excel so that this problem doesn’t arise anymore.

### **Method 2: Use Pivot Table Options**

If, however, above method doesn’t work, follow the below-mentioned steps:

- Right-click on the **Pivot Table** and click on **Pivot Table Options**
- On the Display tab, clear the checkbox labeled “**Show Properties in ToolTips**”
- Save the file (.xls, .xlsx) with the new settings intact

### **Method 3: Make Changes to Pivot Table**

If the above method or steps didn’t work,

- Try opening the **Pivot Table Options** window by right-clicking on the Pivot Table within your Excel file
- Select Pivot Table Options from the pop-up menu and make appropriate changes to the options given there
- Then check if the issues go away

### **Method 4: Check and Set Data Source**

If the problem in the Pivot table is related to data refresh,

- Go to **Analyze > Change Data Source**
- Check if the data source is set properly
- Also, try reselecting the data source and check if the refresh option is working properly

If not, resorting to **Stellar Repair for Excel** software might be your only hope.
