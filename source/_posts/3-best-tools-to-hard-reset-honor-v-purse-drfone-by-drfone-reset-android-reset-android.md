## Using Honor V Purse Hard Reset in What Situations?

### 1: Erase All Data and Settings

One of the most common reasons for a hard reset is to erase all data and settings from the phone. When your phone runs out of storage, you can only delete the previous data if you want to save something new. Although Honor V Purse phones provide a lot of storage and support SD cards, you can only erase unwanted data if you run out of space. Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an **Honor V Purse hard reset**. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.

### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don't like an update's new features and settings. Before your **Honor V Purse hard reset**, make sure to backup your data on cloud storage to restore it afterward.

- Tap on the “Reset Options” in the system menu.
- Tap on Erase all data or factory reset.
- Enter the Password and tap reset for confirmation.

- Power off your mobile phone.
- Hold the volume up and power buttons.
