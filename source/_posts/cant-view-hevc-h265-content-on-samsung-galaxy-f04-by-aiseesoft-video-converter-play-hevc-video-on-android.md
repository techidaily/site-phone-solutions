    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Samsung Galaxy F04 and it failed terribly. Does Samsung Galaxy F04 come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Samsung Galaxy F04 on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
