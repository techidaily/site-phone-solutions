## Using Infinix Note 30 Hard Reset in What Situations?

When your phone runs out of storage, you can only delete the previous data if you want to save something new. Although Infinix Note 30 phones provide a lot of storage and support SD cards, you can only erase unwanted data if you run out of space. Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an **Infinix Note 30 hard reset**. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.

### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don't like an update's new features and settings.

- Tap on the “Reset Options” in the system menu.
- Tap on Erase all data or factory reset.
- Enter the Password and tap reset for confirmation.

### 2: Restore with Recovery Mode

Suppose you want to hard reset your locked Infinix Note 30 phone, use the recovery mode. With recovery mode, you don't have to go to settings and erase data after providing the password. The only drawback of using recovery mode is that it is not best for beginners. Follow these steps for your **Infinix Note 30 hard reset** using recovery mode.

![wipe data factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925871266656.jpg)

However, wipe data/factory reset does not affect the SD card in any way. So, even if you have the SD card inserted with videos, images, documents, and any other personal information in the Android device while carrying out a factory reset, everything will remain safe and intact.

## Part 2: How to perform Wipe Data/ Factory Reset?
