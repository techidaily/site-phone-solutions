In this blog, we will talk about different ways to delete photos from iPhones beyond the scope of recovery.

## **How to Delete All Photos from iPhone?**

Before deleting all photos from the iPhone, it’s important to take a backup of all photos to avoid any accidental data loss situation. There are various ways to back up your iPhone photos:

### **1\. iCloud**

Use iCloud to back up all your photos automatically. To sync iCloud with Photos –

- Go to **Settings** > \[**your** **name**\] > **iCloud** > **Photos**, and turn on **iCloud** **Photos**.

Your photos will be backed up to iCloud automatically if your device has enough storage space and is connected to Wi-Fi.

### **2\. iTunes:**

You can even use iTunes to back up your iPhone photos. To do this,

- Connect your **iPhone** to your system.
- Launch **iTunes** and then select your **device**.
- Click **Summary** > “**Back Up Now**” to create a backup of all your data, including photos.
