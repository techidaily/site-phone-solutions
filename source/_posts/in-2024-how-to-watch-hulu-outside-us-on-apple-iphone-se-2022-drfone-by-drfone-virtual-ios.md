## Part 2: Urgent FAQ about Fake Location on Hulu

You can also clear the cache on your system and restart to again try connecting Hulu with

VPN. Some of the other solutions that might work include taking the help of the VPN support team, checking for IP and DNS leaks, disabling IPv6, or using a different VPN protocol.

The home location will apply to all the Apple iPhone SE (2022) devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.
