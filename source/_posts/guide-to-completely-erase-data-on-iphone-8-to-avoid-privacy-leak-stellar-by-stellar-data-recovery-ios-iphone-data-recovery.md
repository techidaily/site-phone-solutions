## Guide to Completely Erase Data on iPhone to Avoid Privacy Leak

With growing instances of data leak and misuse, there's a fear of digital data on iPhone landing in wrong hands. Personal photos, messages, videos, contacts, or sensitive information such as bank details, shopping apps ID etc., are at risk when selling, trading off, recycling or donating your iOS device.

So what can you do to keep your old iPhone data away from strangers' eyes and make it 100% unrecoverable?

One solution is the commonly used Apple's recommendation — erase iPhone data by choosing 'erase all content and settings' on your device. However, with professional hackers and sophisticated software available, erasing data by this method doesn't guarantee data privacy.

Experts suggest using trusted iPhone erasure software that is 100 % safe. The software can make iPhone data unrecoverable beyond the reach of any tool.

Let's understand in detail how to permanently erase data on iPhone by these techniques.

![erase iphone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Erase-Data-on-iPhone-to-avoid-Privacy-Leak.jpg)

## **Clean iPhone by using 'Erase All Content and Settings'**

To clear all data from iPhone use the'Erase All Content and Settings' option in the settings of your iOS device. It is like factory resetting your iPhone.

All the app data, settings, passwords, photos, videos, contacts, documents, messages, Calendar, chats, music, audio files etc., gets deleted after factory reset from iPhone.

However, don't forget to first take the [backup of your iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/article/how-to-back-up-iphone.php) in iCloud or iTunes.

**Steps to erase iPhone via Settings:**

- Go to **Settings.**
- Navigate to **General > Reset**\> **Erase All Content and Settings**.

This will erase iPhone data turning the device off. When you power on the iPhone, you will see all its data is deleted including, photos videos, apps, contacts etc.

## Permanently wipe iPhone to 0% recovery – Secure & tested method
