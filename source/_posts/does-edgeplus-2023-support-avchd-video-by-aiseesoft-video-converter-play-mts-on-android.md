    Wanna watch MTS clips copied from your AVCHD camera on Motorola Edge+ (2023)? AVCHD is a popular file-based format for digital recording and playback of high-definition video. Most Android phones or tablets lack native support for AVCHD MTS footage. You can either use a third party media player like VLC or MX player to play MTS files on your Motorola Edge+ (2023), or convert AVCHD footage to MP4 format that is well compatible with Motorola Edge+ (2023).

  “I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do with AVCHD .mts files on my Motorola Edge+ (2023). They were taken with a Panasonic camera. I’d like to watch them on Motorola Edge+ (2023), but it refused to play them. So I'm stuck. Has anyone else figured out how to play the files in this .mts format on Motorola Edge+ (2023)? Any suggestions?”

  The native video player on your Motorola Edge+ (2023) will not support AVCHD files. However, you have two options to go through the issue. You can either install a third party video player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, MoboPlayer, etc.) or convert AVCHD .mts files to MP4 format via using a converter app. Check out a guide on how to re-encode AVCHD .mts files for playing on Motorola Edge+ (2023).
