**Step 2:** Launch Dr.Fone

![wondershare drfone software interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** Choose Virtual Location and connect your phone.

![wondershare drfone virtual location module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Itel P55 users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Itel P55. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Itel P55 app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

## Part 3. Pros and Cons of Fake GPS location - Hola

Hola Fake GPS Android app or the Chrome Extension has its own set of benefits and limitations, depending on the context and intended use. Here are some of the pros and cons of using a Hola Fake GPS location changer:

### Pros

- **Privacy**: Hola Fake GPS location is usually used to conceal your actual location and protect your privacy on the internet.
- **Access geo-restricted websites and apps**: Hola Fake GPS allows you to access restricted content on the internet by changing the server location.
- **Testing and development**: If you are designing a location-based application or service, you can use a Hola Fake GPS to conduct such processes.
- **Online security**: by masking your real location and IP address, Hola Fake GPS protects you from cyber attacks.

### Cons

- **Ban from the application or service**: Hola Fake GPS does not use high-end technology, so many services can identify its use and ban you.
- **Legal issues**: Depending on the local laws of the land, there could be legal issues and heavy fines if you are caught using the Hola Fake GPS tool.
- **Security risks**: Hola Fake GPS does not use encrypted technology, so there is always room for others on the internet to identify and cause cyber attacks.

### See What Fake GPS location - Hola's Users Have to Say

Hola Fake GPS location has mixed reviews from users. Here's what users have to say about the Hola Fake GPS application:

**Vikas Divyakirti on G2 Says:**

"Hola Fake GPS is a great service for anyone looking for a simple and location-changer application. The interface is really simple to use, and the time spent on the app is always a seamless experience. The security features offered are not that top-notch, but if you are looking for a free application just to change your location, then Hola Fake GPS is the way to go."

**Sheron on G2 Writes:**

"Hola Fake GPS has been a disappointing experience for me, and I'm pretty sure it will be for you. The attractive pricing and fast speed promise seem like it is the best location spoofer on the internet, but believe me, any other service on the internet is better than this. The company now constantly gets negative feedback from the giants like Google for its privacy violation. Overall, I would ask you not to download Hola Fake GPS app."

## Part 4. Is Fake GPS location - Hola Safe?

No. There is no grey area here. For years, the Hola Fake GPS Android app has been marked as one of the worst apps to change your location. It explicitly collects users' data, monitors users' activity, and sells them to third-party vendors that track you online.

Moreover, the accessible version of Hola Fake GPS isn't even encrypted, so there is always a chance of a man-in-the-middle attack, and so on.

Not to forget, Hola Fake GPS and its parent app, the HolaVPN, have also been removed from the Chrome Web Store numerous times. Additionally, it has a long history of controversies. So, it is only better to look for alternatives to Hola Fake GPS.

## Part 5. Comparison of Fake GPS location - Hola and Its Competitor Dr.Fone - Virtual Location

As mentioned, there are many disadvantages to using Hola Fake GPS. From non-encryption to collecting user data, the concerns are more, and the benefits of using the Hola Fake GPS app are less. That is the reason we suggest you use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. Unlike Hola Fake GPS, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced algorithms to spoof your location.

## Bonus Tips: How to Use HolaVPN and a Location Spoofer to Fake GPS on Pokémon?

Pokémon Go is hugely popular, but some countries block players from accessing certain features or from downloading it at all. A free VPN service, HolaVPN, can be used to change your IP location to unblock Pokémon Go in these areas.

### 1\. What is HolaVPN?

HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant. Plus, it does not alter the location of a chosen application but all the applications on the internet. This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.

### 2\. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?

Various situations might prompt you to use HoleVPN in the Pokemon Go game. For example, some countries restrict players from downloading the Pokemon Go game or gaining full access to some in-game features. Also, some Schools and organizations' networks usually restrict players from playing the Pokemon Go game, so you need a VPN to be able to access the game.

### 3\. How to use a HolaVPN with Pokémon Go?

**Step 1.** Download the HolaVPN app on your device. Then, launch it and sign in to or create an account.

**Step 2.** Spoofing your GPS location on Android or iPhone requires a third-party app. Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is one of the best GPS spoofing apps.

**Step 3**: Locate the country you wish to change your location to and tap on it.

**Step 4:** Once you're connected to a particular country, your phone location will change instantly.

### In conclusion

Hola Fake GPS location is not the best application to change your GPS location. But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.

However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can't find your actual GPS location.

Overall, if you are looking for the ultimate tool to spoof your GPS location, then [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is the best way to go.
