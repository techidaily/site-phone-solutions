### The Bottom Line

Factory resetting is not ideal for some problems, but sometimes it becomes the only possible solution. So, if you have your phone stuck or want to sell your old phone, you need to **factory reset Itel P40+**. But make sure to back up your phone before going for a reset. You can back up your files before a factory reset using Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android).
