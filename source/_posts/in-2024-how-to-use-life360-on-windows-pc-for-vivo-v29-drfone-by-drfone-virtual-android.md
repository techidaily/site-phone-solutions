## How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Vivo V29?

Life360 is an online platform that utilizes geo-location services to help users share their real-time location with friends and family. The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.

As of now, you cannot run **_Life360 on computer_** as it is only available for Android and iOS. _Why?_ Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.

However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the **_Life360 app for Windows_**. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the **_Life360 app on Windows_**.

So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.

## Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?

First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get **_Life360 for PC_**. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.

In this situation, you can simply run the **_Life360 app on PC_**. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.

Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.

## Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?

Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.

The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.

However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and **_run the app on a Windows PC_**. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.

These methods include:

## Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator

The first and the most convenient way to run **_Life360 on computer_** is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.

While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.

Here’s how you can run **_Life360 on a computer_** using Bluestacks Android emulator./

Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.

Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.

![bluestacks 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg)

Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.

![bluestacks 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg)

Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.

![bluestacks 13](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg)

Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.

![bluestacks 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg)

## Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC

While running an emulator is a great way to get **_Life360 on PC_,** it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.

In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run **_Life360 on PC_**. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.

Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.

Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.

![mirroring android 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg)

Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.

![mirroring android 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg)

Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.

![mirroring android 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg)

Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.

![mirroring android 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg)

Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer. Any action that you perform on your device will be replicated on your computer screen as well.

## Final Verdict

Life360 is probably among the top family locators for Android users. Apart from its extensive range of features, the app provides a user-friendly interface, which allows it easier for even elders to use the app without any issues. Even though there isn’t a dedicated Life360 software for Windows, you can follow the above-mentioned methods to run the **_Life360 on PC_**.

## iSpoofer is not working On Vivo V29? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Vivo V29 device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)

## Spoofing Life360: How to Do it on Vivo V29?

In an era where location tracking has become a norm, many individuals value their privacy and wish to have more control over their location data. Whether you want to maintain your privacy, simulate being in a different place, or have other reasons for altering your Life360 location, this guide is here to help. We will explore the reasons why you might consider spoofing your Life360 location and provide you with step-by-step instructions on **how to** **fake your location on Life360** on both iPhone and Android devices. Let's delve into the world of location spoofing and regain control of your whereabouts.

## Part 1: What is Life360?

Life360 is one of the admired apps known for tracking location. The app can be used as a location-sharing platform as well as you can chat with your friends via the in-app chat feature. Here are the basics. All this app suggests is that a group of people whether an office projects group or simply a college team or maybe the family members, download and [install Life360 on their phones](https://www.virtuallocation.com/life360/). Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.

After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.

![life360 app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg)

Using this app then, you can simply see the location of the other members as well as get notifications named Place Alerts. These notifications will tell you whether a user has arrived or left the selected location. This can be helpful if you are a parent and want your children to reach safely at a desired place.

Moreover, with the help of Life360, a user can easily control the ‘Check-in’ according to which he or she sends the alert to the circle to know them the exact location. You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.

## Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?

Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.

For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.

For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.

## Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360

To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.

- This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.
- Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.
- Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.

## Part 6: How to Stop Life360 from Tracking you

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

![settings of Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.

**Step 3:** Hit on "Location Sharing".

![go to Location Sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying "Location Sharing Paused" and you are done.

![pause location sharing for Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg)

**Note:** When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Vivo V29 device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.

3. **How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words
