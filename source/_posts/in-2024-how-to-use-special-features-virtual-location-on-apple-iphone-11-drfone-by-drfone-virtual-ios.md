## How To Use Special Features  - Virtual Location On Apple iPhone 11?

With all these amazing features, you can easily change your iOS location without blinking an eye.

### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

![apply fluctuation mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png)

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Step 2Import a GPX File

For importing a GPX file on the platform, click the **Import** button on the right pane. As this opens a window, select the GPX file you wish to import to the platform.

![import gpx file to the platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Step 3Wait for the File to be Read

Wait for a moment until Dr.Fone - Virtual Location recognizes the specific locations within the GPX file and displays them on the map.

![wait for gpx file to load](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

### Part 6: Historical Records

If you want to use a similar track record on your smartphone again, you can access the historical records saved on the platform for easy access.

Step 1Open Historical Records

Click the **Historical Records** button on the right pane to access the entire history involving the connected smartphone and the location spoofing platform.

![access historical records](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-1.png)

Step 2Access Any Location from the History

Select the **Go** button adjacent to any particular historical record to re-launch a similar simulation for the Apple iPhone 11 device. You can also click **Clear All** to delete all historical records.

![move to any location from history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-2.png)

### Part 7: Favorite List

You can also set up favorite locations within the platform to define quick accessibility to your favorite locations. To do that, you have to follow the guidelines shown next:

Step 1Favorite Specific Locations

While setting up locations in Jump Teleport Mode, One-Stop Route, or Multi-Stop Route, you can tap on the **Favorite** icon adjacent to every marked location or favorite an entire route with the **Favorite** icon on the top of the left panel.

![save locations as favorite](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/find-favorites.png)

Step 2Access your Favorite Section

To look for your favorite locations, look for the **Favorite** icon on the right pane to open a list containing all locations you have marked. You can choose the **Move** option to automatically move into a particular location in no time.

![search for favorite locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/search-favorites.png)



## How to Fix My Apple iPhone 11 Location Is Wrong

GPS navigation has changed a lot of the things that we do on a day-to-day basis. It has alleviated all the concerns that you would usually have before going to do an errand, visiting a new location, or going on a road trip with your friends. Instead of planning your route a few days in advance, you can find the safest route with just a few taps on your phone, giving you more time to focus on other things.

While using your phone to track your current location, you might have noticed that it is not showing you the correct location. It will confuse you but it does happen from time to time, and there will be fixes that you can do get to track properly. There are also multiple factors that you will need to consider when you encounter an issue where your phone has shown you a completely different location compared to where you are. We will talk about those possible issues and how you can fix them and get them to work properly again.

## Part 1: Why is My Location Wrong on My Apple iPhone 11?

As we have mentioned earlier, there are multiple reasons why your location is not being tracked accurately by your phone. We understand how crucial to ensure that the location is accurate, especially if you are using this to send someone something or if you plan to go somewhere.

### _Reason #1:_ The location services are disabled on your phone

The most basic common reason as to why your current location is wrong is that you could have disabled the GPS or location services on your phone.

### _Reason #2:_ Internet connectivity on your mobile is unstable

Another common issue as to why your location is wrong on your phone is that your mobile's connectivity is unstable. This could be due to your mobile provider, or the location that you currently are in might not have any stable internet connection and is causing your location to be wrong.

### _Reason #3:_ Your mobile phone might not be updated

Another reason your phone has the incorrect location would be that your phone is updated to the latest software update. The software update will usually include fixes to the old software update's bugs.

### _Reason #4:_ The “Location Services” might not be enabled for the application

If you have not enabled the application to use the GPS, then it will not show you the correct location. Make sure to check whether this application can access the “Location Services” by following the steps below.

## Part 2: How to Fix Apple iPhone 11 Location Accuracy Issue?

Now that you know the possible causes of why you have an incorrect location, we will not share with you the fixes that you can do to get a more accurate location when you use your phone.

### _Option #1:_ Enable the “Location Services” on your phone

To fix the wrong location issue, you will need to check that your “Location Services” are turned on. You can enable the “Location Services” by following the steps below.

- **_Step 1:_** Go to “Settings” and choose “Privacy”.
- **_Step 2:_** After, you can look for “Location Services” and enable it.

### _Option #2:_ Update your iOS to the latest update

It is important to regularly update your phone with the recent software updates to prevent any inaccurate locations on your phone.

- **_Step 1:_** Go to “Settings” and look for “General”.
- **_Step 2:_** Look for “Software Update”, from there you will see whether you have the latest iOS. If your phone is not updated, then you can go ahead and update it.

### _Option #3:_ If you are using another application, make sure that the application is updated as well

Similar to your iOS, the application needs to also be updated, so double-check if the application needs to be updated as well. You can do this by going to the App Store and checking if the application needs to be updated and if it does, do update the app and you can retry tracking your location after.

### _Option #4:_ Enable the “Location Services” for your phone

Double-check if the location services are turned on on your phone so it will show you an accurate location.

- **_Step 1:_** Open the “Settings” on your phone and scroll down to look for “Privacy” then tap on it.
- **_Step 2:_** Next, click on “Location Services” and check to see whether the location is turned on. If it is turned on, turn it off and back on again.

## Part I: Purpose of Mock Location Apps

The sole purpose of mock location apps or software is to help users spoof/ mock location to somewhere they are physically not. This may or may not be illegal/ immoral depending on how you use the apps, but who are we to judge! We are here to simply help you with the process.

- Prank your friends and family by showing your location in some other country and have some healthy laughs at their expense!
- Access geographically restricted content such as on streaming platforms. Mocking your location to somewhere where your favorite shows and movies are available helps you watch them from the comfort of your home, wherever in the world that may be!

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your Apple iPhone 11 and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

## Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone

There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple's strict policies on user privacy and security. Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data.

A quality product from Wootechy, iMoveGo is compatible with the latest iOS 17 and works well for what it does. It does not require jailbreak and comes with a trial version you can use to see what it does and if it fits your purpose.

#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.



## Part IV: Top Mock Location Apps for Android

Now for the top location spoofer apps on Android OS! Some from above are also compatible with and fully support Android going up to version 14, so you might see duplicates.

#### 1\. GPS Emulator

iToolab AnyGo for Android works in over 100 games and apps and can simulate movements between two points. The speed of movement can be customized and the app does not require you to root your Apple iPhone 11.

#### 4\. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

![drfone virtual location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-android.jpg)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world.

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Closing Words

You can use it for practical purposes such as saving money on dating apps by mocking location on Android and iPhones to anywhere around the world to meet new people. You can use it to simulate movement anywhere in the world in location-based games. You can also use mock location apps to effectively change your geographical location to watch content not available in your true geographical area.
