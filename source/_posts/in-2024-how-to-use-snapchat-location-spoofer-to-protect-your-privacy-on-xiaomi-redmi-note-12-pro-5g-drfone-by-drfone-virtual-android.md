## How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G?

People are very happy about Snapchat’s new Snap map feature. It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.

![snap map feature](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg)

This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.

This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!

## **Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?**

The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?

Yes, Absolutely!

There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.

**Ghost Mode:** The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -

**Step 1:** If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.

![track camera screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg)

**Step 2:** On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.

![find bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg)

**Step 3:** The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.

![location setting on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg)

**Step 4:** The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.

![duration ghost mode](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg)

If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.

**Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone**

If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.

**Android**

The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.

**Step 1**: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.

![check location notification tray](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2**: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on/off.

![tap location on/off](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg)

**iPhone**

To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,

**Step 1:** Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.

![go to setting on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg)

**Step 2:** Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.

![tap privacy option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg)

**Step 3:** In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.

![click location services option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg)

**Step 4:** Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.

![turn off location service](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg)

These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.

## **Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat**

If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.

[Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Step 1**: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.

![dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Now connect Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3**: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4**: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.

![set the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.

**VPN Service - NordVPN**

The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.

![nordvpn google play store](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.

![signup for quick connect](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.

![choose the server](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg)

So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.

## **Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?**

A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.

**Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?**

A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.

**Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?**

A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.

## **Part 4: Conclusion**

Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.

## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.
