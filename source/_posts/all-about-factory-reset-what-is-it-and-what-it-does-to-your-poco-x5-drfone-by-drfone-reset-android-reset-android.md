### Method 1: Reset Poco X5 phones through the Phone Settings menu

To unlock the screen and reset your Poco X5 phone, the settings menu of the Poco X5 device can be used. For this method, you do not need to make your device enter the recovery mode. The steps for the process are as follows.

- **Step 1.** On your Poco X5 phone, open the Settings app and look for the **Backup and Reset** option from the **Personalization** section.
- **Step 2.** Next, select **Factory Data Reset** Option.
- **Step 3.** Go through the on-screen details and then click on the **Reset device** button.

The steps above will reset your phone to the default factory settings.

### Method 2: Reset Poco X5 phones with factory reset code

There are Android Reset Codes for different brands of phones that can be used for resetting the Poco X5 device. These secret codes can be different phones as well as OS versions. In general, the code used for resetting Poco X5 phones is **\*#\*#2846579#\*#\***.

Steps to reset Poco X5 phone using secret reset code

- **Step 1.** On your Poco X5 phone, go to the dialer and type the code- **\*#\*#2846579#\*#\***.
- **Step 2.** From the menu, click on the **Restore Factory** option.
- **Step 3.** Finally, to confirm the resetting of the Poco X5 device, click on the **OK** button.

The above methods can also be tried if you get stuck in a situation on how to factory reset Poco X5 tablets without password. Also, we recently covered a method of how to bypass the Google account on Poco X5 after a factory reset, we have now had the opportunity to test this with many people with different models of Android and have found mixed results.
