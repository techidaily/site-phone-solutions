## Life360: Learn How Everything Works On Motorola Moto G14

Nothing is more important than your mobile device when it comes to your security, privacy, and family. Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.

Whether you're looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you've ever seen.

It's the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it's not the cheapest. So, let's know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.

## Part 1: What Is Life360?

A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one's safety and well-being.

When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members' arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.

Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.

Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.

Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.

Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.

In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user's location on the Life360 website.

## Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?

Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.

The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.

You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.

Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.

## Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?

Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.

According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.

If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app's location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.

You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.

There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.

Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.

Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.

## Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?

What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.

Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) which can help you change your location in real-time.

## Part 6: FAQs

### 1\. What are Life360 events?

Although Life360 events are a great way to keep your loved ones informed about your whereabouts, they also provide information about your location, like the weather, time, and date. You can even set an alert when you arrive at a specific location.

For example, if you want to see who is at your house, you can set an event to notify you when someone enters or leaves your home.

### 2\. What does protecting a drive on Life360 do?

Improve your family's driving habits by getting a weekly picture of everyone's driving habits. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the driving patterns of every member of the Circle.

Find out about things like your highest speed and whether or not you text while driving, among other things. Then, take a look at individual drives to find out details such as the exact route taken, the number of kilometers recorded, the peak speed, driving style, and the locations of any driving incidents.

When Circle members are on the road, whether driving, using public transportation, or traveling with companions, keep an eye on their peak speed.

### 3\. Why does life360 show walking instead of driving?

In brief, it is because walking is less likely to be used for commuting than driving. For example, if you live in a rural area, you may not have access to public transportation, and therefore, you would have to walk to work.

### 4\. What does it mean when life360 doesn't update?

It means that the Motorola Moto G14 device you're using is not connected to the internet. In this case, you should check if your internet connection is working properly. If you're sure your internet connection is working fine, try restarting your device.

### 5\. Does Life360 work when your phone is off?

In the event that you switch off your phone, the GPS feature will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your phone is turned off.

However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data uploaded to your account. So, a life360 login online is necessary.

## Conclusion

Life360 is a useful application that helps you keep tabs on your loved ones. You can track location, receive notifications, and get alerts. But if you want to fake your location, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is the most recommended product because of its unique features and easy-to-use interface.

Here are the basics. All this app suggests is that a group of people whether an office projects group or simply a college team or maybe the family members, download and [install Life360 on their phones](https://www.virtuallocation.com/life360/). Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.

After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.

![life360 app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg)

## Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?

Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.

For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.

For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.

To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.

- This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.
- Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.
- Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.

## Part 6: How to Stop Life360 from Tracking you

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

![settings of Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.

**Step 3:** Hit on "Location Sharing".

![go to Location Sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying "Location Sharing Paused" and you are done.

![pause location sharing for Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg)

**Note:** When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Motorola Moto G14 device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.

3. **How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words

Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option. We discussed some helpful ways **how to fake your location on Life360** in this article, including [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) which allows you to manipulate your GPS location, simulate routes, and set up geofences, making it a versatile solution for your location spoofing needs. Hope you find this helpful.
