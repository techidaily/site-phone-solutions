## Fix Cannot Paste the Data Error in Microsoft Excel

When copying and pasting the cell contents or attributes from one workbook to another, you can encounter the "Cannot paste the data" error. The error indicates that the values you are trying to paste do not match the cell format (Currency, Date, Text, etc.) used in the column. The error can occur if you are attempting to paste information into a merged cell. You can also get this error if the data you are trying to paste contains more columns than the destination worksheet can accept or if the copy area and paste area aren't the same size.

## Why you cannot Paste the Data in Microsoft Excel?

You can experience the "Excel cannot paste the data" error due to one of the following reasons:

- Locked cells
- Data size limitation
- Formatting issues
- The file size is too large
- Overloaded clipboard
- Data type mismatch
- Invalid range
- Lack of permissions
- Excel file is corrupted
- Compatibility issues
- While pasting the merged cells

## **Methods to Fix MS Excel Cannot Paste the Data Error**

The "Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data" error usually appears when copying and pasting data within the spreadsheet. It primarily affects the copy-and-paste feature within the Excel file. However, the impact of this error may vary with the data you are working with. When this error occurs, first try restarting the Excel application. Ensure that you've saved all your important data before restarting the application to prevent data loss. If, after performing this basic step, you still face the issue, then try the following troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check and Unlock Cells in Excel**

You can get the Excel cannot paste the data error if the cells you are trying to paste in the Excel file are locked. You can check and unlock the specific cells in the Excel file using the below steps:

- Go to the **Home** tab in your Excel file and click **Format Cell Font** popup launcher.

![Clicking Cell Font In Home](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-format-cell-font-on-home-tab.jpg)

- In the **Format Cells** dialog box, click **Protection**.

![Selecting Protection from Font family with formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-protection-in-format-cells.jpg)

- Under the **Protection** option, unselect the locked field and then click **OK**.

![Click on Locked Cell under Protection Tab](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-locked-under-protection.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Fix the Cell Format**

Sometimes, you can get the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel if there is an issue with the formatting of the cells in the column (in which you are trying to paste the data). You can check whether the cell formats of the columns of the source file (from where you are copying data) match the destination file (in which you are pasting the cell data). If not, then change the cell format. Here's how to do so:

- In the Excel file, click on the affected column heading (whose cells you need to modify).
- Navigate to the **Home** tab and click the **General** dropdown menu.

**![Navigate to Home and Click general drop down menu in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-general-dropdown-menu.jpg)**

- Click on the desired cell format that matches the values you are trying to paste into the column.

### **Method 3: Check Copy and Paste Area Size**

The "data cannot be pasted" issue can also occur if Excel detects the copy area of the range of cells is not of the same size and shape as that of the paste area. So, make sure the size of the range of cells for the paste area is same as the copied area. To ensure this, you can try the following:

- **Use Upper-left Cell**

 You can select the upper-left cell instead of the complete range to paste.

- **Use Paste Special Option**

- You can use the **Paste Special** option to paste the data. To use this option, go to **Home > Paste Special**.

![Navigate to Home And click on Paste Special in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-and-then-click-paste-special.png)

- You can choose from the different options, such as paste all, formulas, operations, Transpose, skip blanks, etc. to take control over how the data is pasted.

![Click on Paste and Selection of Operations from Paste Special Properties](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-operations-from-paste-special.jpg)

### **Method 4:** Check and Unmerge Cells

The merged cells in the workbook can create discrepancies when copying and pasting data. These can create mismatch between the source and destination cell areas, resulting in errors. Make sure you are not pasting the data copied from merged cells. You can check and unmerge the cells using the below steps:

- Open the Excel file (in which you are copying data) and go to the Home tab.
- Click Merge & Center > Unmerge Cells.

![Under Excel Navigate to Home and click on Merge and Center](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-click-on-merge-and-center.jpg)

### **Method 5: Unselect the Excel DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) Option**

Sometimes, you can get the Excel cannot paste the data error while copying and pasting data from Excel file to external data sources or applications. It usually appears if you have established DDE links between them. To resolve this, you can uncheck the "Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)" option. Follow the below steps to do so:

- Open your Excel file.
- Go to **File > Options**.

In **Excel Options**, click **Advanced** and unselect **"Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**. Click **OK.**

**![Under Excel Navigate to Home and click on Merge and Center](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-ignoring-dynamic-data-exchange-option.jpg)**

## Here are some additional solutions you can try to fix the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel

### **Check the Excel File Format**

Sometimes, the copy and paste error can occur if you try to move data from an older version of Excel file (XLS) into a newer version file (XLSX) or vice versa. You can try to change or convert the file format to resolve the issue.

### **Clear Clipboard**

Too many items on the clipboard can prevent you from copying and pasting the data. You can [empty your clipboard](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/clear-the-clipboard-7afbf55f-d7d5-4096-87a0-eb17f821d321) by deleting all clips. To do this, go to **Home** and click the **Clipboard** option.

### **Change the Column's Cell Format**

You can get the "Cannot paste the data" error when the information you need to paste does not match the cell format in the column. In such a case, you can change the column's cell format. To do this, navigate to the **Home** option and then click on the **General menu** arrow. Then, change the cell format suitable to the type of information you are trying to paste in that column.

### **Add Columns**

The copy-and-paste error in Excel can also occur if there are not enough columns to accept the data that you are trying to paste. You can insert more columns and then try copying and pasting data. To insert additional columns, click on the column heading, click **Home**, and then select **Insert.**

### **Remove Incompatible Add-ins**

Sometimes, incompatible or faulty add-ins can also create conflicts with Excel's clipboard operations, leading to the error. To check if add-ins are causing the issue, open the Excel file in safe mode. In safe mode, if you are able to paste the data, then check and uninstall the incompatible Excel Add-ins.

## **What to do if Nothing Works?**

If the above methods do not work, then corruption in the Excel file could be the cause of the "Cannot paste the data" error. In such a case, you can use Excel's built-in Open and Repair utility to repair the corrupted file. Here's how to use this utility to repair the Excel file:

- Open your Excel application.
- Navigate to **File** and then click **Open.**
- Click the **Browse** option to select the affected Excel file.
- The **Open** dialog box opens up. Click on the corrupted file.
- From the **Open** dropdown, select the **Open and Repair** option.
- The Excel will prompt you to choose one of the below options:
- Repair
- Extract
- Cancel
- Select the **Repair** option to extract maximum data from the file. If the Repair option fails, choose the **Extract** option to recover the data, excluding formulas and values.

 The [Open and Repair utility may not be able to repair your Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) if it is severely corrupted.

## Excel AutoRecover not working, what is next?

## Consider a Scenario

A professional with Windows 10 computer had MS Office 2016 installed on it. For an official purpose, he worked on an Excel workbook and saved it as an XLSX file. After working for hours on it, which was saved with a file name, a power outage occurred in his building for quite some time. After the power was back, he reopened Excel to find a list of recovered files in ‘Document Recovery’ section on the screen’s left side. However, the file that he had worked on recently was the ‘Original version,’ i.e. the last version saved by him and not the auto-saved Excel file. This meant the Excel document did not have any new data that was entered since the last time he saved it. Consequently, he lost hours of work. According to him, this happened despite the fact that the ‘AutoRecover’ feature was enabled. (Still, this needs to be checked and ensured.)

The 'AutoRecover' feature might not work in any of these cases:

- **AutoRecover Feature is disabled -** With this feature disabled, the Excel files are not auto-saved if the document is closed without saving, or the document closes unexpectedly due to an untoward incidence. To check, see if ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto-saved version if I close without saving’ checkboxes are checked or unchecked. If either one is unchecked or both are unchecked, it signifies that the AutoRecover feature is disabled. Else, the AutoRecover is enabled.
- **Corruption in the Excel XLSX file –** If ‘AutoRecover’ is enabled, most probably the cause is ‘damaged Excel XLSX file.’

Before discussing solutions to resolve the ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, let's have an overview of the 'AutoRecover' and 'AutoSave' features.

## A Brief Overview of Excel AutoRecover and AutoSave Feature

AutoRecover is an inbuilt feature in MS Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, 2003, and 2007 that allows saving all of the ‘open Excel files’ at a fixed-interval in a user-specified location or AutoRecover file location. Besides, AutoSave is an add-in that exists in Excel 2002 and earlier versions to save all open Excel files in case of a crash, power outage, or accidental closure of Excel files without saving. Users can recover these files if Excel closes suddenly, for instance, at the time of power outage or failure. The auto-recovered Excel files are saved at a default location.

## Methods to Fix ‘Excel AutoRecover Not Working’ Issue

### Manual Methods

### Method 1 - Enable the 'AutoRecover' Feature if Disabled

Make sure that you have the ‘AutoRecover' feature enabled in your Excel application. If not, follow these steps to enable it:

- Open Excel with MS Excel 2016/2019
- Click on File and then on Options tab
- In ‘Excel Options’, click on Save tab
- Check ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto saved version if I close without saving’ box
- Set the time in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’
- Click on the OK button

Note: With this method, it is not possible to recover data from the current Excel file. From next time onwards, the AutoRecover feature starts working following which Excel shall start auto-saving Excel files as per the time set in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minute’.

### Method 2 - Repair Corrupt Excel File

If corruption in Excel XLSX file has resulted in ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, you will need to [repair Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). Use **‘Open and Repair’** inbuilt utility to fix and repair the damaged (corrupt) Excel file and extract its data. To use the inbuilt utility, execute the following steps:

- Go to location “C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles” to find Excel TMP files and save it as XLSX file

Note: In Windows 8, the location is the same as mentioned above that is for Windows 10. In Windows 7, the location is “C:\\Users\\name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\”

- Open a blank **Excel** sheet; click **File >> Open**
- Go to the location and folder containing the damaged Excel file
- In the **Open** dialog box, choose the damaged Excel file and click the arrow next to the Open button, and then click **Open and Repair**
- In the window that appears, click **Repair** to recover as much data as possible

Now, open the Excel (XLSX) file to check if the Excel file is repaired and its data is recovered.

## How to fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid error in Excel?

The Pivot Table field name is not valid error can occur while creating, modifying, or refreshing data fields in the pivot table. It can also appear when using VBA code to modify the pivot table. It usually occurs when there is an issue with the field name in a code or if there is a hidden or empty column in the pivot table. However, there could be many other reasons behind this error.

## Why the "Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid" Error Occurs?

You can get the "Pivot Table field name not valid" error in Excel due to several reasons. Some possible causes are:

- Excel file is corrupted
- Damaged fields in the pivot table
- Pivot table is corrupted/damaged
- Hidden columns in the pivot table
- Macro (referring to the pivot table) is corrupted
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Missing or incorrect fields in the VBA code
- Issue with workbook.RefreshAll method syntax (if using)
- Pivot Table contains empty columns
- Header values or header column is missing in the Pivot Table
- Pivot table is created without headers
- Columns/rows are deleted from the Pivot Table

## Methods to Fix Pivot Table Field Name is not Valid Error in Excel

You can get this error if you have selected the complete data sheet and then trying to create the Pivot Table. Make sure you choose only the data fields that you want to insert in the Pivot Table. If this is not the case, then follow the troubleshooting methods mentioned below.

### **Method 1: Check the Header Value in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot table field name is not valid" error can occur if you have not set up the pivot table correctly. All the columns having data in them should have header and header values. A pivot table without a header value can create issues. You can check the header and its value from the Formula bar. Change the header if the header value is too lengthy or if it contains special characters.

![Adding reference for the document with details.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/headers-value-in-formula-bars.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Change the Data Range in the Pivot Table**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" can occur while modifying a field in Pivot Table. It usually occurs if you're trying to add or modify the field by selecting an incorrect data range in the **Create PivotTable** dialog box. The **"Create PivotTable**" feature helps define how data would be displayed within the pivot table.

Let's take a scenario to understand this. Open the Excel file with PivotTable. Click on the fields (you want to add), go to the **Insert** option, and click **PivotTable.**  

![Inserting a Pivot Table from selection](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-insert-and-then-pivot-option.jpg)

If you select an incorrect range, i.e. A1:E18, instead of correct range - "Expenses**!$A$3:Expenses!$A$4**," you will immediately get the error message.

![Selecting a table range with values for report](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-table-with-correct-range.jpg)

So, type the correct range under the Select a table or range option and click **OK**.

### **Method 3: Unhide Excel Columns/Rows**

The error can also occur if some columns/rows of the Pivot Table's data source are hidden. When you try to add a hidden column as a field in the PivotTable, the Excel application will fail to read the data of the hidden column. You can check and unhide the Excel columns by following these steps:

- Open the Excel file.
- Locate the hidden column number.
- Move your cursor on the hidden column number and right-click on the space between the columns. Click **Unhide**.  

    ![unhiding the rows in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-unhide-option.jpg)

### **Method 4: Check and Delete Empty Excel Columns**

Sometimes, you can get the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error if you are trying to use an empty column as a field in your Pivot Table. Check the columns with no values in all cells. If found, then delete the empty columns. This method is ideal for small-size Excel files. However, for large-sized files, it is a time-consuming process.

### **Method 5: Unmerge the Column Header (If Merged)**

The "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error can also occur due to merged column headers. The pivot table references headers to identify the data inside the rows or columns. The merged headers can sometimes create data inconsistencies. You can try unmerging the column headers to fix the issue. Follow these steps:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Home**
- Click the **Merge & Center** option and select **Unmerge Cells** from the dropdown.  

    ![unmerging cells from home tab in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-home-select-unmergecells.jpg)

### **Method 6: Disable the Background Refresh Option**

If the "background refresh" option in the Excel file is enabled, it may also create issues with Pivot Table. The Excel updates all the pivot tables in the background even after a small change if the background refresh option is enabled. This may create issues if the Excel file is large with too many tables. You can try turning off the "background refresh" option in the Excel file to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Data** tab and then click **Connections**.  

    ![Adding connections from the data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/go-to-data-then-click-connections.jpg)

- In the **Workbook Connections**dialog box, click on the **'Add'** dropdown to add the workbook (in which you need to modify the refresh settings).  

    ![Add the option for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-add-from-drop-down.jpg)

- Once you have chosen the Excel file, click **Properties.**  

    ![Selecting Properties for the Workbook connections.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/click-properties-on-workbook-connections.jpg)

- In the **Connection Properties** window, unselect the **"Enable background refresh"**option, select the "**Refresh data when opening the file**", and click **OK.  

    ![Enabling the connection properties by enabling and refreshing data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivotimage/select-background-refresh-and-refresh-data-option.jpg)

    **

### **Method 7: Check the VBA Code**

The error can also occur when working with PivotTable using VBA code in Excel. Some Excel users reported this error on forums as **run-time error 1004: The PivotTable field name is not valid**. This error usually occurs when there are issues in the VBA code, affecting the PivotTable data source or field references. You can check field names referring to PivotTable or Workbook.RefreshAll function syntax and other errors in the code.

### **Method 8: Repair your Excel File**

One of the reasons behind the "Pivot Table field name is not valid" error is corruption in the Excel file, containing the Pivot Table. You can repair your Excel file using Microsoft built-in utility - Open and Repair. Here's how to use this utility:

- In Excel, navigate to **File > Open.**
- Click **Browse** to choose the affected workbook.
