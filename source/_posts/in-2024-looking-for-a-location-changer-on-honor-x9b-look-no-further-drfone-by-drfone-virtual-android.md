**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Honor X9b users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Honor X9b. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Honor X9b app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Honor X9b

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.

## How to Share Location in Messenger On Honor X9b?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

![facebook messenger live location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg)

The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.
