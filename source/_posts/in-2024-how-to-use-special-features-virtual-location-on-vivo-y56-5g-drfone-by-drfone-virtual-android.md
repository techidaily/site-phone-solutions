### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

![apply fluctuation mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png)

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Step 2Import a GPX File

For importing a GPX file on the platform, click the **Import** button on the right pane. As this opens a window, select the GPX file you wish to import to the platform.

![import gpx file to the platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Step 3Wait for the File to be Read

Step 1Open Historical Records

Click the **Historical Records** button on the right pane to access the entire history involving the connected smartphone and the location spoofing platform.

![move to any location from history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-2.png)

### Part 7: Favorite List

You can also set up favorite locations within the platform to define quick accessibility to your favorite locations. To do that, you have to follow the guidelines shown next:

Step 1Favorite Specific Locations

While setting up locations in Jump Teleport Mode, One-Stop Route, or Multi-Stop Route, you can tap on the **Favorite** icon adjacent to every marked location or favorite an entire route with the **Favorite** icon on the top of the left panel.

![save locations as favorite](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/find-favorites.png)

Step 2Access your Favorite Section

To look for your favorite locations, look for the **Favorite** icon on the right pane to open a list containing all locations you have marked. You can choose the **Move** option to automatically move into a particular location in no time.

![search for favorite locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/search-favorites.png)



## Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Vivo Y56 5G?

Life360 is an excellent family security service provider that notifies family members and loved ones about the user's temporary location with GPS tracking and action alerts. In addition, life360 uses texts and notifications to help circle members keep track of everyone's location, driving habits, and frequently visited places. Still, most people don't use the app because they think it restricts them with message tracking and other features that look familiar to some spying apps. For those who want to know does life360 notify when you log out, you will find out everything about that in this article.

Life360 can track your device's location and texts, but it can't read your texts, and people outside your circle can't view your location, so your privacy is safe using this app. All circle members get a location paused notification when logging out or turning off the location. Read till the end to learn how various life360 features work and can you log into life360 on a computer. We also have solutions to turn off locations without others knowing on any family tracking app.

## Part 1: How does the life360 location work?

Life360 gives a peace-of-mind to you and your family members by tracking your location, so everyone in your circle knows where is the other person and what are they doing; if the user is driving, then everyone will get a notification about their driving habits, and circle members can check location data history. All the circle members must have the life360 app downloaded and running in the background of their devices. Circle members can see the exact location of the user when the location services are on. Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.

Its one-tap location features allow circle members to see everyone's location data on the map. The app gives a route to the other person's current location by tapping any member pointer. If someone is in danger or got an emergency, they can tap the panic button to send a mass text to the circle with their location. The app does not notify when circle members check someone's location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.

## Part 2: Does life360 notify when you leave?

As the best family locator app, life360 notifies circle members about any user's security or app-related activities. In addition, the app notifies all circle members when someone leaves or is removed from the circle. Does life360 notify when you log in to a new device? Yes, it does. The user can log into multiple devices but only once at a time. As soon as the user changes devices, everyone gets a notification with the new device's location.

There are multiple life160 notifications for different scenarios. Everyone gets a "user removed" notification when a user leaves a circle. As long as the location sharing is on, circle members will get a notification when someone turns their location off. Suppose someone's phone is dead, or there is a poor connection. In that case, life360 puts an exclamation mark next to that user's name to notify other circle members.

## Part 3: How to turn off location on life360 without anyone knowing?

Although life360 provides excellent family location services, it also affects your privacy by tracking your location and texts as long as the phone and location services are on. It is the same for other family tracking apps. For example, suppose users want to attend to some private matters or want others to respect their privacy. The best way is to turn off their location on life360 so no one can track them, but it is not an option because you can't do that on life360. Using a third-party location-changer app is the best solution in this case.

[Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location-changer application that allows users to change their device's location with one click. It provides a fake location to all tracking applications like life360 to help users protect their privacy.

## Thinking About Changing Your Netflix Region Without a VPN On Vivo Y56 5G?

Netflix is easily one of the most popular streaming apps available today. It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.

The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you're interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.

![change region without vpn netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg)

## Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions

Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.

Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix's Terms of Use. If you're caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant's Terms of Use.

## Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?

If you're wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don't”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you're connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.

## Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?

There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you're on your computer, iPhone, or Android. You can use a smart DNS service, a Proxy Server, or a [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to connect to a country you want to access. Follow our guide below to change country on Netflix now without a VPN.

### Method 1: Using a Smart DNS

Utilizing Smart DNS to change country on Netflix without VPN actually works in the same way. This is because Smart DNS re-routes your connection through a server in a different country. Keep in mind that Smart DNS is still a service and will require a subscription from a Smart DNS provider.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different online DNS providers. In this example, you'll see using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Register your IP address on your selected provider and obtain the appropriate DNS Server Address on your account.

![change dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open **Networking** settings on your computer, iPhone, PlayStation, or Xbox and find **DNS Settings** (the image below is an example for the Windows system).

![change dns server wifi properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address. Click **Ok** once done and restart your computer. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**Pros**

- DNS servers are faster than a usual internet connection, so you can enjoy streaming at high connection speeds.
- DNS Servers don't encrypt your traffic or hide your IP address.

**Cons**

- DNS doesn't carry your information, as the server side will only see the IP address where the query came from, which hackers can manipulate.

### Method 2: Using a Proxy Server

Proxy Servers work the same as VPNs as it routes traffic to a third-party server. However, like DNS, Proxy Servers don't encrypt data but can mask your IP address. Here are the steps to watch NetFlix with a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Search for **Proxy Settings** on your computer.

![change proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 2**: Choose between **Automatic** or **Manual proxy setup**.

**Step 3A**: For **Automatic proxy setup**, turn on **Automatically detect settings** and **Use setup script.** Afterward, enter the **Script address** and click **Save.**

![automatic proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 3B**: For **Manual proxy setup,** click **Use a proxy server**. Input **Address** and **Port** numbers. Click **Save** afterward.

![manual proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-3.jpg)

**Note**

To change Proxy on mobile phones, change your phone's proxy settings. Your Netflix app will automatically copy your phone's proxy settings if done correctly.

**Pros**

- Proxy Servers mask your IP address retaining anonymity.
- Proxies improve web browsing performance, especially when downloading large files.

**Cons**

- Proxy Servers don't encrypt data.

### Method 3: Using a [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

For the unfamiliar, Tor is an open-source network that encrypts your connection while stopping trackers from following your activity. Here are the steps to start using Tor Browser to watch Netflix without a VPN.

**Step 1**: Download and install [**Tor Browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

![tor browser for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/tor-browser.jpg)

**Step 2**: Launch **Tor Browser** and click **Connect**.

**Step 3**: Go to **Netflix.com** and log in to your account.

**Note**

Tor Browser is available across all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

**Pros**

- Tor is completely free to use.
- Your browsing history automatically gets deleted.

**Cons**

- You can't control the region you have access to, so your Netflix content is not guaranteed to have what you're looking for.

### Conclusion

Changing your Netflix region with or without a VPN certainly has its perks. This is because you can watch your favorite series unavailable to your country to maximize your streaming access. Choosing a country with a lower subscription price also saves you money.

While it's not illegal to change your Netflix region, it does violate the streaming giant's Terms of Use. You should always research and know the pros and cons when circumventing Netflix's terms so your account doesn't get suspended or terminated.
