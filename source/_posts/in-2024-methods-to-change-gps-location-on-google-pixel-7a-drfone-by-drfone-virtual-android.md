The application will never go to waste, won't occupy much of your computer/PC/Laptop's space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.



## Part 2: Change GPS Location on Google Pixel 7a using External Device

You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Google Pixel 7a location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone's geographic location.

The best external device to change phone location Google Pixel 7a is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -

**Step 1**: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone's port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Google Pixel 7a device to your iPhone.

![double location dongle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg)

Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location's official website.

**Step 2**: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.

![companion app double location map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg)

**Step 3**: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.

## Part 3: Change GPS Location on Google Pixel 7a using XCode

You can change the geolocation Google Pixel 7a by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Google Pixel 7a by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Google Pixel 7a stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you've never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -

**Step 1**: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.

![download xcode app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg)

**Step 2**: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the 'Single View Application' to start a new Project and go on by clicking on 'Next'. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.

![single view application project](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg)

**Step 3**: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.

![identify yourself](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg)

**Step 4**: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config --global user.email "[<u>you@example.com</u>](mailto:you@example.com)" and git config --global user. name "your name".You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.

**Step 5**: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Google Pixel 7a device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.

![iphone connects to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg)

**Step 6**: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the 'Build Device' option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Google Pixel 7a unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.

![process-detection-on-iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg)

**Step 7**: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu > Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Google Pixel 7a as well.

## Part 4: Change GPS location on Google Pixel 7a using Cydia Location Faker App

Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.

**Step 1**: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.

![cydia app download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from 'OFF' to 'ON' at the bottom of the page.

![cydia toggle shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg)

**Step 4**: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an 'i' icon. Go click on it and choose the 'White List' option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone's location.

## Part 5: Change GPS Location on Google Pixel 7a using Location Handle

Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store

![location handler cydia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg)

**Step 2**: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.

![teleport-coordination](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg)

**Step 3**: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.

![manual mode location handle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg)

**Step 4**: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.

![chowchilla location handler](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg)

**Step 5**: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.

## Thinking About Changing Your Netflix Region Without a VPN On Google Pixel 7a?

Netflix is easily one of the most popular streaming apps available today. It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.

The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you're interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.

![change region without vpn netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg)

## Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions

Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.

Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix's Terms of Use. If you're caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant's Terms of Use.

## Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?

If you're wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don't”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you're connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.

## Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?

There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you're on your computer, iPhone, or Android. You can use a smart DNS service, a Proxy Server, or a [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to connect to a country you want to access. Follow our guide below to change country on Netflix now without a VPN.

### Method 1: Using a Smart DNS

Utilizing Smart DNS to change country on Netflix without VPN actually works in the same way. This is because Smart DNS re-routes your connection through a server in a different country. Keep in mind that Smart DNS is still a service and will require a subscription from a Smart DNS provider.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different online DNS providers. In this example, you'll see using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Register your IP address on your selected provider and obtain the appropriate DNS Server Address on your account.

![change dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open **Networking** settings on your computer, iPhone, PlayStation, or Xbox and find **DNS Settings** (the image below is an example for the Windows system).

![change dns server wifi properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address. Click **Ok** once done and restart your computer. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**Pros**

- DNS servers are faster than a usual internet connection, so you can enjoy streaming at high connection speeds.
- DNS Servers don't encrypt your traffic or hide your IP address.

**Cons**

- DNS doesn't carry your information, as the server side will only see the IP address where the query came from, which hackers can manipulate.

### Method 2: Using a Proxy Server

Proxy Servers work the same as VPNs as it routes traffic to a third-party server. However, like DNS, Proxy Servers don't encrypt data but can mask your IP address. Here are the steps to watch NetFlix with a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Search for **Proxy Settings** on your computer.

![change proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 2**: Choose between **Automatic** or **Manual proxy setup**.

**Step 3A**: For **Automatic proxy setup**, turn on **Automatically detect settings** and **Use setup script.** Afterward, enter the **Script address** and click **Save.**

![automatic proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 3B**: For **Manual proxy setup,** click **Use a proxy server**. Input **Address** and **Port** numbers. Click **Save** afterward.

![manual proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-3.jpg)

**Note**

To change Proxy on mobile phones, change your phone's proxy settings. Your Netflix app will automatically copy your phone's proxy settings if done correctly.

**Pros**

- Proxy Servers mask your IP address retaining anonymity.
- Proxies improve web browsing performance, especially when downloading large files.

**Cons**

- Proxy Servers don't encrypt data.

### Method 3: Using a [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

For the unfamiliar, Tor is an open-source network that encrypts your connection while stopping trackers from following your activity. Here are the steps to start using Tor Browser to watch Netflix without a VPN.

**Step 1**: Download and install [**Tor Browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

![tor browser for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/tor-browser.jpg)

**Step 2**: Launch **Tor Browser** and click **Connect**.

**Step 3**: Go to **Netflix.com** and log in to your account.

**Note**

Tor Browser is available across all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

**Pros**

- Tor is completely free to use.
- Your browsing history automatically gets deleted.

**Cons**

- You can't control the region you have access to, so your Netflix content is not guaranteed to have what you're looking for.

### Conclusion

Changing your Netflix region with or without a VPN certainly has its perks. This is because you can watch your favorite series unavailable to your country to maximize your streaming access. Choosing a country with a lower subscription price also saves you money.

While it's not illegal to change your Netflix region, it does violate the streaming giant's Terms of Use. You should always research and know the pros and cons when circumventing Netflix's terms so your account doesn't get suspended or terminated.

## How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Google Pixel 7a

Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.

![spotify music app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg)

But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.

## **Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify**

But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.

**Region specific Content**

![spotify region specific content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg)

Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.

**Playlists and Recommendations**

![spotify region geography playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg)

Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.

So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.

**Payment Plans**

![potify payment plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg)

The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.

**Spotify Unavailable**

![spotify unavailable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg)

Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.

## **Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?**

You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -

**Step 1:** Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.

![spotify log in page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.

![spotify acct overview](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.

![new location on spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg)

If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.

**Step 4 (Premium):** In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.

![premium-account-change-plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg)

## **Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?**

Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.

**Step 1:** You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare[Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Step 2:** Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.

![ dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Google Pixel 7a to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5:** Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The New Location will now display on your iPhone/Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.



## **Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.

Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.

**Step 1:** Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.
