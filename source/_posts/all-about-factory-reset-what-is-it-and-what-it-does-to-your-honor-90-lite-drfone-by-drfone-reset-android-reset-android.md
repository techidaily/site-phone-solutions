## The Easiest Methods to Hard Reset Honor 90 Lite

You can use **Honor 90 Lite A37 hard reset** to solve your various smartphone problems. If your Honor 90 Lite runs slower and its screen gets stuck, a hard reset can clear these problems. A hard reset also helps when you want to erase all data from your device before you sell. Suppose your phone runs out of storage. You can save your data on cloud storage and do a factory reset to free up space. You can also use it to unlock your device by removing the screen lock.

When you do a factory reset from settings, you will need the Honor 90 Lite device's password. Dr.Fone is the best tool to hard reset your Honor 90 Lite without a password. It has an easy-to-use UI, and safe data backup features to enable users to back up their data before resetting. Here is the complete guide to hard reset your Honor 90 Lite using three methods.

## Part 1: In What Cases Should I Hard Reset My Honor 90 Lite?

### 1: Can't Unlock it (forgot password, too many wrong attempts)

Most people **hard reset Honor 90 Lite** because they forgot the lock screen password. When you can't remember your phone's password, a hard reset is the fastest way to unlock your device. With a hard reset, you can delete all types of data and settings from your device. It helps you remove passwords, PINs, patterns, and fingerprint locks. Once you forget your phone's password and enter the wrong password too many times, you will get a blocking alert. After another wrong attempt, the system will block your device. When you reach this point, you can only use a hard reset to unlock your device.

### 2: Honor 90 Lite Works too Slowly
