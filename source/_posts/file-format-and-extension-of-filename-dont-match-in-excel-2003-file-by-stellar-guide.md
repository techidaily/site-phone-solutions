You can encounter the **“File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe”** error when the Excel application detects any issue with the file. This happens when you try to open an old version file format in a newer version or if the file is received from an unsafe destination. This can prevent you from opening the Excel file.

**As indicated from the error message, this error occurs due to the following reasons:**

- The file has incorrect file extension.
- The file is corrupted.
- The file you are trying to open is protected.

Now, let’s see how to resolve this Excel error.

## **Methods to Fix the “File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match” Error**

Try the following methods to troubleshoot the “File format and extension don’t match” error in Excel.

### **Method 1: Rename the Excel File**

You can face the “File format and extension don’t match” issue if the file has incorrect extension. It can occur if the file extension has been altered or you’ve mistakenly saved the file with incorrect extension. To fix this, you can try renaming the Excel file with the correct file extension.  

### **Method 2: Check the Default Excel File Format**

Different versions of Microsoft Excel use different default file formats. For example, .xls is the default file format of older versions (2003 and lower) of Excel, whereas .xlsx format is used by the newer versions (2007 and later). Opening the Excel file with an incompatible extension can cause the “File format and extension don’t match” issue. You can check the Excel version you are using and ensure it’s compatible with the Excel file you are trying to open.

### **Method 3: Change the Protected View Settings**

You may receive the “**File format and extension of excel don’t match**” error if the Excel file is protected. You can check and try disabling the [Protected View settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653).  

**Caution:** Changing the Protected View settings can put your system at risk. If the Excel file is being downloaded from the internet, it may contain viruses that can infect your system. So be careful before disabling the Protected View settings.

### **Steps to Change Protected View Settings in Excel:**

- In the Excel’s File menu, click on **Options.**
- Select **Trust Center > Trust Center Settings**.

- Under **Trust Center**, select **Protected View** and disable the below three options:
- Enable Protected View for files originating from the internet.
- Enable Protected View for files located in potentially unsafe locations.
- Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments.

![In the Trust Center Window, go to the Protected View tab and Disable all Protected View Checkboxes.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/select-all-the-options-under-protected-view.jpg)

- Click **OK.** Then, try to open the Excel file.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide the Excel File Permissions**

Sometimes, you can get the error if you don’t have sufficient permissions to open the Excel file. This usually happens when you try to open the Excel file received from other sources. You can check and provide the desired permissions to fix the error. Here are the steps:

- Locate the affected Excel file, right-click on it, and select **Properties.**
