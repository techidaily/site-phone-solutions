Imagine the frustration of an employee if an Excel workbook he took hours to complete became corrupted for some reason threatening to erase all the data saved in it. Not just that, a corrupted Excel workbook can wreak havoc for the organization too since it poses a risk of permanently deleting critical business information like work records or employee trackers.

Unless a backup of all important Excel files exists, recovering data lost due to damage/corruption to them is next to impossible. However, we’ve conducted some research and found some pretty neat hacks to help you extract data from corrupt excel files without much hassle.

## Primary reasons triggering Excel file corruption

As we always point out, to solve a problem for good, getting to its root is imperative. Here are the main reasons that cause Excel file corruption. Knowing these reasons can help you keep Excel corruption at bay for a considerably long time.

- Abrupt system shutdown when you’re editing an Excel sheet
- Bugs / Defects in your Excel application or installation
- Hardware failures like bad sectors on the hard drive where Excel sheets are saved
- Virus Infection / Malware Attack
- Excessive data storage within a single Excel file
- Faulty Excel Macros and CSE Formulas

Depending upon the extent of damage, there can be several ways to perform corrupt Excel file repair.

## How to repair corrupt Excel files?

There are a couple of manual methods that can help you [repair corrupt Excel files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

1. **If the damaged Excel sheet can be opened, immediately save its copy; thereafter**:
    - Open it with a later version of Excel and save it as a new workbook.
    - If this doesn’t work, open it in Excel’s latest version and save the workbook in HTML or HTM format.
    - Once this is done, reopen the HTML file and save again in XLS format.
    - Lastly, open the file and try saving it in SLK format (symbolic link)

**Note:** It is important to note that saving an Excel workbook in HTML format causes loss of features like custom views, scenarios, unused styles or number formats, natural language formulas, data consolidation settings, custom function categories, etc. In SYLK format only the active worksheet is saved so if using this method, you’ll need to repeat these steps for each worksheet.

2. **Use Excel’s inbuilt Repair function as follows:**
    - Launch Microsoft Excel and go to **Office button -> Open**
    - In the Open dialog box, select the damaged Excel file
    - On the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog box, you will find a drop-down next to **Open** Click on it and select **Open and Repair**
    - This will launch the inbuilt Repair module of Excel and you’ll see a dialog box asking you to select an option from **Repair** or **Extract Data**
    - Click on **Repair** to initiate the repair process.
    - If this doesn’t work, repeat steps 1-4, and when Excel asks you to select an option, select **Extract Data** from corrupt excel file. Thereafter, follow the instruction Excel shows and you should be able to retrieve your data, but you may end up losing some formulas.
3. **If you cannot open the Excel, download Spreadsheet viewer from the Microsoft website and open the file using this program. Thereafter copy all data into a new Excel.**

**Note:** This method will cause much of your formatting, formulas, and more to be lost.

4. **You can download Open Office from its official website OpenOffice.org and try opening the Excel in it. The two programs are very similar so all data should automatically align in the correct place and with the correct formatting.**

**Note:** With this method, VBA code cannot be recovered due to incompatibility between OpenOffice.org and Excel.

## Solutions to Fix MS Excel Crash Issue

Following are some solutions to resolve problems with MS Excel such as,

- Excel not responding
- Excel won't open
- Excel keeps crashing

Follow these solutions in the given order. In case a method doesn't work, move to the next one.

### Solution 1: Restart Excel in Safe Mode

By starting MS Excel in safe mode, you can run the program without loading the Excel add-ins and with limited features. But COM add-ins are excluded.

To launch Excel in safe mode, close MS Excel and follow these steps,

- Create a shortcut of MS Excel (.exe) on Desktop
- Press and hold the Ctrl key while launching the program
- Click 'Yes' when a prompt appears to confirm

Alternatively, press Windows+R, type excel /safe and press 'Enter'. Use this to open Excel in safe mode on Windows 10, 8.1, 8, or 7 system.

![type excel /safe](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel8.jpg)

Now try to open and access the Excel file and check if the issue is resolved. If it's not, head on to the next solution.

### Solution 2: Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins

In case Excel doesn't crash in Safe Mode, it's possible that some faulty add-ins are the culprit behind frequent Excel crash and freeze. These Excel add-ins may interfere or conflict with the Excel program.

![Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel9.jpg)

Find and remove the faulty add-in. It can resolve the issue. To do so, follow these steps,

- Restart Excel in normal mode and go to File> Options> Add-ins
- Choose COM Add-ins from the drop-down and click Go

![COM Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel10.jpg)

- Uncheck all the checkboxes and click OK

![Uncheck all the check boxes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel11.jpg)

- Restart Excel and check if the issue is resolved
-  If Excel doesn't crash or freeze anymore, open COM Add-ins and enable one add-in at a time followed by Excel restart. Then observe Excel for freeze or crash problem

This will help you find out the faulty add-in, which is causing the problem. Remove the add-in which is causing the problem to resolve the issue. If that doesn't fix, move to the next solution.

### Solution 3: Check and Install the Latest Updates

If you haven't set Windows to Download and Install Updates automatically, do it now.

Apart from updating the operating system, latest Windows updates sometimes fixes bugs for other applications installed on the system such as MS Office. Often installing an important update that you might have missed may correct the Excel crash problem.

You can also update MS Office manually. Follow these steps,

Go to File > Account

 Under Product Information, select Update Options and click Update Now

![Product Information](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel12.jpg)

If you have installed MS Excel from Microsoft Store, open the store and update your Office applications.

NOTE: This also works if you can't open Excel file or Excel crashes after Windows upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10.

After installing the latest MS Office updates, check if Excel works fine. If not, head to the next solution.

### Solution 4: Clear Conditional Formatting Rules

If a sheet is causing Excel to freeze or crash, there might be a problem with that particular sheet. In such a case, you may try clearing the Conditional Formatting rules. The steps are as follows,

- Under Home, click 'Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules\> Clear Rules from Entire Sheet'

![Conditional Formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel13.jpg)

- You may repeat this step for all other sheets in the Excel workbook
- Then click File> Save as and save the Sheet as a new file at a different location

This avoids overwriting or making changes to the original Excel file. Once done, try working on the sheet.

If this doesn't work out, move to the next solution.

### Solution 5: Remove Multiple Cell Formatting and Styles

If a workbook is being shared and edited by others on different platforms then it's possible that many cells are formatted differently. This can cause issues with Excel such as crash and freeze. It can also lead to Excel file corruption. The problem mostly occurs when a workbook contains multiple worksheets using different formatting.

You can [follow this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/troubleshoot/excel/too-many-different-cell-formats-in-excel) to remove different cell formats and styles, and then open the Excel file.

### Solution 6: Disable Microsoft Excel Animation

Animations require additional processing power and resources. By disabling animations in Excel, you may resolve Excel freeze and crash issue. This also improves MS Excel performance.

To disable the animations in MS Excel, follow these steps:

- Go to File > Options
- Click 'Advanced' and check 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'animation

![Disable hardware graphics acceleration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel14.jpg)

- Click 'OK' to close the window and then restart MS Excel

This has helped many users in fixing the Excel crash issue. If it doesn't work for you, head to the next solution.

### Solution 7: Check If Excel File is Generated by a Third-Party Application

There are applications which you may have used to generate Excel files to fetch data. For instance, downloading data from Google Analytics in Excel format.

Sometimes, these Excel files are not generated correctly by such third-party apps. Thus, some features in Excel may not work as intended when you access the files in MS Excel.

In such a case, you should get in touch with the app developer for help with the file or use Stellar Repair for Excel to repair such Excel files.

### Solution 8: Check If Antivirus or Other Apps are Conflicting with MS Excel

Ensure your antivirus is up-to-date and not conflicting with MS Excel. An outdated antivirus tool may conflict with Excel which can cause the application to hang, freeze, or crash.

- Update your antivirus
- Try disabling the add-in or integration between Excel and antivirus. See if it works

Alternatively, you may disable the anti-virus tool temporarily to check if it is the culprit behind Excel performance issue and crash. If that resolves the problem, get in touch with your antivirus vendor and report the problem.

They might provide you with a better solution or workaround to fix this problem without disabling the antivirus protection.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Disabling or altering antivirus protection makes your PC vulnerable to malicious attacks and virus or malware intrusion.

### Solution 9: Clean Boot Windows to Inspect the Cause Behind Excel Crash

When Windows boot, it starts several processes, services, and application during start up automatically, which runs in the background.

These startup apps and services can interfere with other applications such as MS Excel. To find out if that's the cause behind Excel crash, you can perform a Clean Boot.

This helps you identify processes, services, or applications that are conflicting with Excel. Steps to perform Clean Boot are as follows,

- Press Windows key + R, type MSConfig, and press 'Enter'
- In System Configuration window, click on the General tab and choose Selective startup

![System Configuration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel15.jpg)

Uncheck 'Load startup items' and click 'OK'

After this, close all running applications and restart your PC

Check if the crash problem with Excel is resolved. Uninstall the conflicting apps or update them. If your issue is not resolved, follow the next solution.

### Solution 10: Repair or Reinstall MS Office

Repairing Office programs may also resolve Excel crash issues if caused by damaged MS Excel program or MS Office files. The steps are as follow,

- Close all MS Office apps and open the Control Panel
- Click Uninstall a program under Programs

![Uninstall a program](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel16.jpg)

- Click on Microsoft Office and then click on the Change option
- Choose 'Quick repair' and then select 'Repair'
- Click 'Continue' to repair MS Office installation

## Get Rid of corrupt Excel File

**Summary:** What to do when an Excel file is corrupted? This is a common question that is often asked by Microsoft Excel users. If you too are seeking an answer to this question, read the blog to learn about a few manual workarounds and a specialized Excel file repair tool to resolve the Excel file corruption issue.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

An Excel file gets corrupted due to various reasons such as a virus/malware attack, sudden system shutdown when the Excel file is still open, power failure while working with an Excel spreadsheet, etc.

When Microsoft Excel detects corruption in a workbook, it attempts to repair the workbook by starting _‘File Recovery mode’._

**Tip!** If the file recovery mode doesn’t start, you may use the manual repair process or an Excel repair tool, such as Stellar Repair for Excel to repair a corrupted Excel file. The software can help you quickly retrieve contents from a damaged, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel file and restore the file to its original state.

There even exist a few manual tips that can be used to recover data from damaged MS Office Excel files.

## **Workarounds to Use When an Excel File is Corrupted**

**_Note:_** _Before carrying out any of the repair and recovery workarounds, it is advised that you must save a backup copy of the damaged file. This is to prevent your files from turning completely inaccessible in case the methods fail to give desired results._

### **Workaround 1: Use the Open and Repair Method**

If MS Excel cannot repair a corrupted workbook automatically, you can try to do it manually. To do so, perform the following:

- Open the corrupt file, like you normally open any file, by clicking **File** > **Open**.
- Browse and locate the folder containing the corrupted document.
- When the Open dialog box is displayed:
- Select the Excel document.
- Click on the arrow present to the right side of the Open button and select **Open and Repair** option.

![open and repair excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/open-and-repair.jpg)

Figure 1 – Open and Repair Feature

If this doesn’t help repair the broken Excel file or you encounter  [Open and Repair does not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) issue, proceed with the next workaround.

**_Tip!_** _Try an alternative solution, i.e._ **_Stellar Repair for Excel software_** _to repair and recover corrupt Excel files (.xlsx or .xls) when the ‘Open and Repair’ method won’t work._  

### **Workaround 2: Restore an Excel File with a Shadow Copy**

If you’re a **Windows 7 or Vista user,** you can try restoring the corrupted spreadsheet by using a shadow copy (or a previous version). [Shadow copy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Copy#:~:text=Shadow%20Copy%20(also%20known%20as,the%20Volume%20Shadow%20Copy%20service>.) is basically a snapshot (backup copy) of computer files or volumes. The snapshot may contain an older version of your Excel file that has become damaged now. To find out, do the following:

- **Launch File Explorer**, and right-click the folder in which the **file is saved.**
- Choose **Properties.**
- Look for and click the **Previous Versions** tab. This will display a list of entries under **Folder versions** or **File versions**, going back a few days or weeks.
- Double-click one with a date when the file was accessible and could be read. Then, try to open its older version. If it opens, save the older version with a new name and execute the procedure with new file/folder entries.

![Excel file is corrupted](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Shadow-copy.png)

Figure 2 – Volume Shadow Copy

You would have to repeat the process until you reach the point where the file became damaged. With this, you will get a baseline version of the file, but data may still have been lost.

### **Workaround 3: Test your Assumptions**

If you receive a message saying “[**Excel file corrupted and cannot be opened**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)”, you would probably believe it. However, there could be other reasons besides corruption that may cause Excel to throw this error message.

Your Office suite, which Excel is a part of, maybe having some primary issues in it causing problems while opening one Excel document. So, try opening another Excel file to check if the problem exists with all the files or just one.

If other Excel documents work correctly, it means that only the particular document is corrupt. On the contrary, if the issue is with your Office suite, repairing the current Office installation may help fix the issue. For this, perform these steps:

- Go to **Control Panel and click Uninstall** **the Program**.
- Choose **Office.**
- Click Change, and hit the **Repair button.**

You can **reinstall** the entire Office package. Once reinstalled, try to open the file to check if the issue has been fixed and the **Excel file repaired.**

## Easy Steps to Make Excel Hyperlinks Working

**Summary:** This blog discusses why hyperlinks won't work in Excel and solutions to fix it. If nothing works, try using Stellar Repair for Excel software to recover your workbook with hyperlinks and all the data intact.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Hyperlinks in your Excel file could be references to a file’s location on the computer or a location within the same worksheet. Or, hyperlinks might be pointing to a URL. Sometimes, the hyperlinks won’t work and any of the following errors may pop up on your screen on clicking a hyperlink:

**‘Cannot open the specified file.’**

![Cannot open the specified file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-main-error.png)

‘This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.’

![This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-error-1.png)

## Causes of ‘hyperlinks not working in Excel’ problem, and solutions thereof

Here are some of the possible causes behind the ‘hyperlinks not working’ issue and solutions to fix it:

### Cause 1 – Change in the name of the hyperlinked file

If the file name that appears in the hyperlink text is different than the actual file name, it will prevent the hyperlink from working.

#### Solution – Link to the renamed file

Ensure that the links in the Excel file are updated and points to the renamed file. For this, right-click the hyperlink and select ‘Edit the hyperlink’. Next, in the hyperlink address, replace the current filename with the renamed one in the hyperlink address.

### Cause 2 – File name has a pound (#) sign

When you create a hyperlink for a file in Excel, you cannot use a pound character (#) in the file name that appears in the hyperlink. That is because the pound sign is not accepted in hyperlinks and may lead to the ‘Cannot open the specified file’ error.

**Note:** While you can use a pound character in a file name, it cannot be used in hyperlinks in an MS Office document.  

#### Solution – Rename the file name and remove the pound sign

Open the file that contains the ‘#’ sign and rename it by following these steps.

- Right-click the cell containing the hyperlink that is not working, and click **Edit Hyperlink**.
- From the **Address** box, copy the address of the file you are linking to.
- Go to the location where the file is stored, right-click on the file, and click **Rename**.
- Remove the ‘#’ character from the name of the file.
- Go back to the Excel file, right-click on the problematic hyperlink, and choose **Edit Hyperlink**. Next, browse and select the renamed file.
- The renamed file without the pound sign will be added in the **Address** box.
- Click **OK**.

Now try opening the hyperlink.

### Cause 3 – Sudden system shutdown causes abrupt closing of Excel

There may be a discrepancy in the data in hyperlinks when a system shut down suddenly, without properly closing the Excel file. And so, when trying to open a link, it won’t open.

#### Solution – Enable the option to save hyperlinks

There is an inbuilt option in Excel to update hyperlinks every time the workbook is saved. Follow these steps to enable that option:

**Note:** The steps may vary based on the Excel version you are using.

For Excel 2013, 2016, or 2019:

- Open Excel Workbook -> Go to **File**\->**Options**\->**Advanced**
- Scroll down to find the General tab and click on **Web Options**
- Web Options Window pops-up
- In the Web Options Window, go to **Files** Tab and select the ‘**Update Links on save**‘ checkbox
- Click on **OK** button and your option is saved

The steps are also explained in the image below:

![Select Update links on Save in Web Options window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Uncheck-the-option-to-save-Hyperlinks.jpg)

For Excel 2007:

- Click the **Office** button
- Select **Excel Options**, then follow Step 1) to Step 5), as mentioned above and get the Excel Hyperlinks to work again.

A personal macro workbook (Personal.xlsb file) is a hidden workbook in Excel that stores all macros in a single workbook. This allows you to automate processes while working in Excel. Sometimes, when recording macro codes in the personal macro workbook, you may get the message “**Personal Macro Workbook in a startup folder must stay open for recording**”. When you click on the **OK** button, it will show the “unable to record” error. This prevents you from recording the macros. Below, we’ll see the causes behind this error and discuss how to resolve this error.

## **Causes of Unable to Record Macro Error**

## **Methods to Fix the “Unable to Record Macro” Error in Excel**

Here are some possible solutions that can help you resolve the unable to record macro error in Excel.
