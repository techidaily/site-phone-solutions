      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi K70, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi K70 cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi K70 would be a workable solution.

      If your movie contains a audio codec that is not supported by Xiaomi Redmi K70, you may probably encounter audio lost issues when playing it. If that’s the case, we would recommend converting the movie to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi K70 first, such as H.264 AAC encoded MP4, which Xiaomi Redmi K70 will recognize and handle well.
