## How to Fix Excel File Couldn't Open in Protected View

**Summary:** This blog discusses about the Excel error 'The file couldn't open in Protected View' and workarounds to fix the error. If you cannot access the Excel file data, using an Excel file repair tool can help you quickly restore the data to its original state.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Protected View is a feature in Microsoft Excel that opens a file in read-only mode while disabling the editing functions. An Excel file opens in Protected View if the file is from an unsafe location. For example, the file may be opened from an insecure Internet location or downloaded as an Outlook attachment from suspicious senders. In that case, your Excel application won’t let you open the file to protect it against malware or virus attacks.

However, the Protected View feature sometimes prevents an Excel file from opening even if it is from a safe location. Also, opening an Excel file may return an error message ‘file couldn’t open in protected view’.

![the file couldn't open in Protected View excel error](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/file-couldnt-open-in-protected-view-error-1.png)

You may be able to resolve the issue by closing all the open Excel files, closing the Excel application, and then re-opening the problematic file. But this process can take a significant amount of time as you need to close and re-open the Excel application and the file continuously.

## **How to Fix the Excel File Couldn’t Open in Protected View Error?**

Here are some workarounds to fix the error:

### **Workaround 1 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

**Note:** Before disabling the protected view settings, ensure you have a reliable antivirus software installed on your computer to safeguard files against malware or virus attacks.

- Open the Excel file throwing the error, go to **File** and click the **Options** tab.
- From the Options dialog box, go to **Trust Center** and click on **Trust Center Settings**.
- From the Trust Center Settings dialog box, select the **Protected View** tab.
- Uncheck the appropriate option under the Protected View section, and then click **OK** to apply the changes. For instance, uncheck the “Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments” option if the file is a downloaded Outlook attachment.

![disable protected view settings ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/disable-protected-view-2.png)

- Click **OK** again.

Now try opening the problematic Excel file. If it still doesn’t open, try the following workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Repair the Office Installation**

Sometimes, corruption in the Office installation may cause Excel to return the ‘file could not open in protected view’ error. So, try repairing your Office installation and check if it solves the problem.

- Open the Control Panel and click the **Uninstall a program** option under **Programs**.
- Click **Uninstall a program** under the **Programs** tab.
- Right-click the Microsoft Office program you have installed and click the **Change** button.
- Select the **Repair** option and click **Continue**.

![repair office program](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/online-repair-microsoft-office-app-3-1024x387.png)

Once the repair operation is complete, check if you can open the Excel file without any issue.

### **Workaround 3 – Install Latest MS Office Updates**

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing [issues](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54) (such as the Protected View issue) on opening an Office document like Excel, Word, or others – after upgrading Windows to a newer version. This problem may occur due to incompatibility between the Office app and the updated Windows version. You can try to fix the problem by upgrading the Office app, and here’s how:

- Click on the **File** tab in the Excel file that throws an error.
- Click the **Account** tab at the left-hand bottom of the screen.
- From Office Updates, expand **Update Options**, and then click **Update Now**.

![office updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/update-excel-4.png)

After installing the updates, restart your PC and open the Excel file. If this doesn’t work, use the following workaround.

## **Workaround 4 – Convert the File and Rename It**

Some Excel users resolved the ‘Protected view’ issue by renaming their Excel files. But before that, ensure that the file you are trying to open is saved with .xlsx format. If the file type is .xls, you need to convert it to .xlsx format and then rename it. Before converting the file, save a copy of the original file in the desired location.

If the file type is .xlsx, copy the problematic file. Next, open a blank Excel document and paste the copied file. The file will appear as an icon, double-click on it. If it opens without any error, save it with a different name. Hopefully, reaming the Excel file may help resolve the problem.

## **Conclusion**

There is no fixed solution to resolve the Excel error ‘The file could not open in Protected View’. However, the workarounds discussed in the blog have helped users resolve the ‘Protected View’ issue. Make sure to use the workarounds in the same order as explained in the blog.

If you’re having an issue loading the Excel file data due to the ‘Protected View’ error, consider restoring the data using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## Solutions to open Excel Read Only Documents

'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is an error message that usually appears when you try to open an Excel (**XLS** or **XLSX**) file downloaded from the Internet, email, or the network server. It may also appear when you try to open an encrypted or password-protected Excel document. In such a case, MS Excel prevents the user from making any changes to the document.

![error message](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/error-message-1-1.png)

## Reasons behind the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted” Error

There could be several reasons that may cause the error. Some of them are as follows:

- Corrupt or damaged Excel workbook
- Incompatible or unsupported add-in
- Antivirus or malware software conflict
- Read-Only Excel file
- The file is encrypted
- File or drive read/write permissions issues
- Protected Excel workbook
- Damaged or missing MS Office (MS Excel) program files

## Solutions to Open and Edit Read-Only Excel Documents

Below are a few solutions that can help you fix the 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted' error and allow you to open and edit Excel documents.

- **Remove Read-only Attribute from Excel File Properties**

The 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error message may appear when the Excel file property is set to read-only. To check if this is the case, follow these steps:

- Right-click on the particular Excel (xls/xlsx) document and select '**Properties'.**
  - Uncheck the '**Read-only'** attribute and then click the '**OK'** button.

![Illustrates the 'Read-only' attribute in Excel XLSX document](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/read-only-properties-2.jpg)

Now try to open the Excel document and check if the problem is fixed.

- **Adjust Antivirus Settings**

A few antivirus programs block Excel files and other Office documents by opening those in 'read-only' mode. In such cases, try adjusting the antivirus settings to open the Excel files normally. This will allow you to edit, modify, and save the Excel workbook without encountering the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be a read-only or encrypted” error message.

- **Disable Protected-View**

The error may appear when you try to open an Excel file received as email attachments or downloaded from unsafe source. The file may potentially contain viruses, worms, or other types of malware that could damage the system or the server.

To safeguard the system, MS Excel opens such files in **Protected View**. It may also open an Excel workbook in Protected Mode when it detects a problem with the file. This security feature allows you to read or view Excel files and reduces the risks to the computer system or PC.

However, you can click **File > Info** and then click '**Edit Anyway**' to access and edit file content. You may also disable the **Protected View** setting via **_File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings…> Protected View._** However, we do not recommend this.

![Protected View](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Protected-view-3.png)

- **Renew/Activate Microsoft Office**

If MS Office is in a deactivated state or its subscription has expired, the Office documents, including the Excel, could be in 'read-only reduced functionality mode.'

In such a scenario, activate Microsoft Office or renew the Office subscription. Then open the Excel workbook and check if the problem of 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is resolved.

- **Check if OneDrive Storage is Full**

If Excel files are saved on OneDrive with low or no storage space, you may encounter such issues with your files.

To know the amount of free space on OneDrive, follow these steps:

- On your PC, open **Settings** and navigate to OneDrive.
  - Click '**Sync Settings > File Storage**' to see available space.

You may also visit onedrive.live.com, sign in to the account, and then check the available space. If there's no space available or the drive is full, empty the storage space and see if the problem is resolved.

- **Check and Update MS Office and Windows**

Microsoft releases updates to fix known errors. Thus, it is critical to update both Windows and MS Office to the latest release and avoid issues, such as 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted.'

- **Repair MS Office (MS Excel)**

The error 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' may appear due to a problem with your MS Office (MS Excel) program. You can repair the MS Office program to resolve such errors. The steps are as follows:

- Open Control Panel and click **Uninstall a Program** link under **Programs.**
- Choose Microsoft Office from the list and click the **Change** button.

![Change button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/repair-ms-office-4.png)

- Select Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems with MS Office and MS Excel. It will also restore any missing or damaged program files.

![Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/quick-repair-ms-office-5.png)

After the Repair, open the Excel workbook and check if the error is resolved.

- **Check Permissions**

The error message may also appear if you access an Excel workbook from a network or shared drive due to lack of write permission. Make sure you have read and write permissions assigned for the particular network drive. Alternatively, you can copy the file from the network drive and save it in your local folder to access and edit it without encountering this error message.

- **Repair MS Excel File**

If none of the solutions worked, the Excel workbook could be damaged or corrupt. To repair such damaged Excel workbook or spreadsheet, you can use the inbuilt '**Open and Repair…**’ option in MS Excel or install an **[Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)**, such as Stellar Repair for Excel. The software comes in handy when the **Open and Repair** option fails to fix the Excel workbook problems. It repairs the corrupt or damaged Excel workbook, extracts all components and content from the file with 100% integrity, and saves them in a new Excel workbook.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, the 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' error can be resolved by a simple restart. But if it doesn't work, you can follow the solutions discussed in this article to resolve the 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' issue.  However, if the issue is caused due to a damaged or corrupt Excel workbook, these methods may not work.

## Get Rid of corrupt Excel File

**Summary:** What to do when an Excel file is corrupted? This is a common question that is often asked by Microsoft Excel users. If you too are seeking an answer to this question, read the blog to learn about a few manual workarounds and a specialized Excel file repair tool to resolve the Excel file corruption issue.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

An Excel file gets corrupted due to various reasons such as a virus/malware attack, sudden system shutdown when the Excel file is still open, power failure while working with an Excel spreadsheet, etc.

When Microsoft Excel detects corruption in a workbook, it attempts to repair the workbook by starting _‘File Recovery mode’._

**Tip!** If the file recovery mode doesn’t start, you may use the manual repair process or an Excel repair tool, such as Stellar Repair for Excel to repair a corrupted Excel file. The software can help you quickly retrieve contents from a damaged, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel file and restore the file to its original state.

There even exist a few manual tips that can be used to recover data from damaged MS Office Excel files.

## **Workarounds to Use When an Excel File is Corrupted**

**_Note:_** _Before carrying out any of the repair and recovery workarounds, it is advised that you must save a backup copy of the damaged file. This is to prevent your files from turning completely inaccessible in case the methods fail to give desired results._

### **Workaround 1: Use the Open and Repair Method**

If MS Excel cannot repair a corrupted workbook automatically, you can try to do it manually. To do so, perform the following:

- Open the corrupt file, like you normally open any file, by clicking **File** > **Open**.
- Browse and locate the folder containing the corrupted document.
- When the Open dialog box is displayed:
- Select the Excel document.
- Click on the arrow present to the right side of the Open button and select **Open and Repair** option.

![open and repair excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/open-and-repair.jpg)

Figure 1 – Open and Repair Feature

If this doesn’t help repair the broken Excel file or you encounter  [Open and Repair does not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) issue, proceed with the next workaround.

**_Tip!_** _Try an alternative solution, i.e._ **_Stellar Repair for Excel software_** _to repair and recover corrupt Excel files (.xlsx or .xls) when the ‘Open and Repair’ method won’t work._  

### **Workaround 2: Restore an Excel File with a Shadow Copy**

If you’re a **Windows 7 or Vista user,** you can try restoring the corrupted spreadsheet by using a shadow copy (or a previous version). [Shadow copy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Copy#:~:text=Shadow%20Copy%20(also%20known%20as,the%20Volume%20Shadow%20Copy%20service>.) is basically a snapshot (backup copy) of computer files or volumes. The snapshot may contain an older version of your Excel file that has become damaged now. To find out, do the following:

- **Launch File Explorer**, and right-click the folder in which the **file is saved.**
- Choose **Properties.**
- Look for and click the **Previous Versions** tab. This will display a list of entries under **Folder versions** or **File versions**, going back a few days or weeks.
- Double-click one with a date when the file was accessible and could be read. Then, try to open its older version. If it opens, save the older version with a new name and execute the procedure with new file/folder entries.

![Excel file is corrupted](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Shadow-copy.png)

Figure 2 – Volume Shadow Copy

You would have to repeat the process until you reach the point where the file became damaged. With this, you will get a baseline version of the file, but data may still have been lost.

### **Workaround 3: Test your Assumptions**

If you receive a message saying “[**Excel file corrupted and cannot be opened**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)”, you would probably believe it. However, there could be other reasons besides corruption that may cause Excel to throw this error message.

Your Office suite, which Excel is a part of, maybe having some primary issues in it causing problems while opening one Excel document. So, try opening another Excel file to check if the problem exists with all the files or just one.

If other Excel documents work correctly, it means that only the particular document is corrupt. On the contrary, if the issue is with your Office suite, repairing the current Office installation may help fix the issue. For this, perform these steps:

- Go to **Control Panel and click Uninstall** **the Program**.
- Choose **Office.**
- Click Change, and hit the **Repair button.**

You can **reinstall** the entire Office package. Once reinstalled, try to open the file to check if the issue has been fixed and the **Excel file repaired.**

The _Recover Unsaved Workbooks_ option allows you to restore the Excel file that you forgot to save before closing MS Excel or it stopped working. The steps are as follows:

- Navigate to ‘_File > Open._’
- Scroll to the bottom and click on ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks.’ This opens a File Explorer browser window.

![recover unsaved excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/recover-unsaved-document.png)

- Now look for the Excel file that you lost and then double-click on it to open and restore the Excel file.
- Once the file is open, click on **File > Save As** and save it to your desired location.

However, this option works only if you had enabled and set up the ‘_Save AutoRecover information every X minutes_’ option and enabled the ‘_Keep the last AutoRecovered version if I close without saving’_ option.  

![change excel settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/change-settings-excel.png)

Also, this may not restore the most recent copy of your Excel file, but it will surely save your time that went into creating and editing the workbook.

### 2\. Repair and Restore Corrupt or Inaccessible Excel File

If the Excel file you are trying to open or access is corrupt, MS Excel will display an error message. When MS Excel detects corruption, it starts ‘File Recovery Mode’ to repair the Excel workbook.

However, if it doesn’t start automatically, you can manually repair minor corruption error and restore the Excel file by following these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Open** and then navigate to the corrupt or damaged Excel file location.
- Select the file and then click on the arrow beside the ‘**Open**’ button to choose the **‘Open and Repair…**’ option.

![open and repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/open-and-repair-excel-file.png)

![repair corrupt excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repair-corrupt-excel-sheet.png)

If the ‘**Repair’** option fails, use the Extract Data option that extracts values, data, and formulas from the Excel workbook.

### 3\. Revert Excel File to Last Saved Version

When an Excel file gets corrupt or damaged while working, you may revert the Excel file to the last saved version. This allows you to restore the Excel file version that isn’t corrupt or damaged. The steps are as follows,

- Click File > Open.
- Double-click the name of the workbook that you have opened in Excel.
- Click Yes to reopen the workbook.

The workbook opens without any changes you’ve made that might have caused the workbook to become corrupted.

### 4\. Use Excel Repair Software to Restore Excel File

## Excel AutoRecover not working, what is next?

## Consider a Scenario

A professional with Windows 10 computer had MS Office 2016 installed on it. For an official purpose, he worked on an Excel workbook and saved it as an XLSX file. After working for hours on it, which was saved with a file name, a power outage occurred in his building for quite some time. After the power was back, he reopened Excel to find a list of recovered files in ‘Document Recovery’ section on the screen’s left side. However, the file that he had worked on recently was the ‘Original version,’ i.e. the last version saved by him and not the auto-saved Excel file. This meant the Excel document did not have any new data that was entered since the last time he saved it. Consequently, he lost hours of work. According to him, this happened despite the fact that the ‘AutoRecover’ feature was enabled. (Still, this needs to be checked and ensured.)

The 'AutoRecover' feature might not work in any of these cases:

- **AutoRecover Feature is disabled -** With this feature disabled, the Excel files are not auto-saved if the document is closed without saving, or the document closes unexpectedly due to an untoward incidence. To check, see if ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto-saved version if I close without saving’ checkboxes are checked or unchecked. If either one is unchecked or both are unchecked, it signifies that the AutoRecover feature is disabled. Else, the AutoRecover is enabled.
- **Corruption in the Excel XLSX file –** If ‘AutoRecover’ is enabled, most probably the cause is ‘damaged Excel XLSX file.’

Before discussing solutions to resolve the ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, let's have an overview of the 'AutoRecover' and 'AutoSave' features.

## A Brief Overview of Excel AutoRecover and AutoSave Feature

AutoRecover is an inbuilt feature in MS Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, 2003, and 2007 that allows saving all of the ‘open Excel files’ at a fixed-interval in a user-specified location or AutoRecover file location. Besides, AutoSave is an add-in that exists in Excel 2002 and earlier versions to save all open Excel files in case of a crash, power outage, or accidental closure of Excel files without saving. Users can recover these files if Excel closes suddenly, for instance, at the time of power outage or failure. The auto-recovered Excel files are saved at a default location.

## Methods to Fix ‘Excel AutoRecover Not Working’ Issue

- Check ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto saved version if I close without saving’ box
- Set the time in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’
- Click on the OK button

Note: With this method, it is not possible to recover data from the current Excel file. From next time onwards, the AutoRecover feature starts working following which Excel shall start auto-saving Excel files as per the time set in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minute’.

## \[Solved\] Excel Spreadsheet Disappears after Opening

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing ‘Excel spreadsheet disappears after opening’ issue. The problem occurs when attempting to open an Excel file by double-clicking on the file icon or name. The Excel file opens blank grey screen.

![Excel blank screen](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img1.jpg)

Figure 1 - Excel Blank Screen

## **User Instances of ‘Excel Open But Can’t See Spreadsheet’ Issue**

**Instance 1:** The user said that _“Excel 2016 opens to a blank screen and everything is greyed out. Ribbons at the top of Excel are also not present”._

**Instance 2:** The user reported that _“Attempting to open a spreadsheet, either by double-clicking the file or by opening Excel, it opens but only a blank Excel window is visible. When trying to save that particular file, Excel behaves as though there is no file open at all and all the file saving options, such as save, save as, print, etc. are greyed out.”_

## **Causes Behind ‘Excel Open But Can’t See Spreadsheet’ Issue & the Solutions Thereof**

Following are some of the possible reasons behind the ‘Excel open but can’t see spreadsheet’ issue, along with their solutions:

### **Cause 1: Excel File is Hidden**

You may have saved the Excel sheet as a hidden document.

### **Solution: Unhide Excel File**

Verify if your Excel worksheet is hidden by following these steps:

- In Excel, click the **View** tab, and then click **Unhide**.

Note: If the ‘Hide’ tab under the View menu is greyed out, the sheet you’re trying to open is not hidden. In that case, proceed to the next workaround.

![unhide excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img2.jpg)

Figure 2 - Unhide Excel File

- A dialog box will pop-up showing the worksheet name that can be unhidden. For instance, below is an image of Unhide box that lists ‘Daily\_Reports’ spreadsheet under Unhide workbook.

![unhide excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img3.jpg)

Figure 3 – Select and Unhide Excel Workbook

- Click **OK** to unhide your Excel sheet.

If this fails to work, there’s a possibility that the spreadsheet window pane may have slided to one side of the visible desktop. To bring back the displayed area, click the ‘Arrange All’ option under the View tab. If the issue persists, try the next solution.

### **Cause 2: Ignore Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Option is Enabled**

Another reason behind the ‘Excel opens to a blank screen’ issue could be that the “Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)” checkbox is checked in Excel options.

Usually, when you double-click an Excel file, a DDE message is sent to Excel instructing it to open that particular file. But, if you have the ‘Ignore DDE’ option selected, the DDE message sent to Excel to open a workbook is ignored. As a result, the Excel workbook opens a blank screen.

### **Solution: Uncheck the Ignore DDE Option**

Make sure that the ‘Ignore DDE’ option is unchecked by performing these steps:

Note: Skip these steps for Excel 2019 and Excel Office 365.
