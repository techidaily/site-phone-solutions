If you are experiencing the ‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet’ error message in the Excel workbook, it indicates that the [Excel file is corrupt](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) or partially damaged. However, it may also occur due to incorrect reference to a wrong cell or object linking, which is not working. The complete error message says,

_‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet. Check that the cell references, range names, defined names, and links to other workbooks in your formulas are all correct.’_

![Excel found a problem with one or more formula references](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-problem-with-formula-reference.png)

In any case, resolving the error is critical as it doesn’t let you save the file and may result in loss of information from the Excel workbook.

## Reasons for Excel Formula References Error

A few reasons that may lead to such error are as follows,

- Wrong formula or reference cell
- Incorrect object linking or link embedding OLE
- Empty or no values in named or range cells
- Multiple Excel files (not common)

## Methods to Resolve ‘Excel Found a Problem with One or More Formula References in this Worksheet’ Error

Following are a few methods that you can follow to [fix Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) that can’t be saved due to problems with one or more formula references in the worksheet.

### Method 1: Check Formulas

If the problem has occurred in a large Excel workbook with multiple sheets, it’s quite hard to pinpoint the problem cell. In such cases, you can use the Error Checking option that runs a scan and checks for a problem with formulas used in the worksheet.

To run Error Checking in the Excel sheet, follow these steps,

- Go to Formulas and click on the ‘Error Checking’ button

![Error Checking](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-error-checking-1024x431.png)

- This runs a scan on the sheet and displays the issues, if any. If no issue is found, it displays the following message,

_The error check is completed for the entire sheet._

In such a case, you can try saving the Excel file again. If the error message persists, proceed to the next method.

### Method 2: Check Individual Sheet

The problem may also occur due to an issue with one of the sheets in the workbook. To find the faulty sheet and fix the problem, you can copy each sheet content in a new Excel file and then try to save the Excel file.

This will help you find the faulty sheet from the workbook that you can review. This method makes the entire [process of troubleshooting Excel formula](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) reference error quite easy and convenient.

In case the error is not fixed, you can back up the faulty sheet content and remove it from the workbook to save the Excel file.

### Method 3: Check Links

When the Excel file contains external links with errors, MS Excel may display such error messages. To check and confirm if external links are causing the error, follow these steps,

- Navigate to _Data Tab > Queries & Connections > Edit Links_
- Check the links. If you find any faulty link, remove it and then save the sheet

### Method 4: Review Charts

You can review the charts to check if they are causing the formula reference error in Excel. It may take a while based on the size of the Excel file. Sometimes, it’s not practically possible to track down which Excel chart object is causing the error. Thus, you need to check specific locations, such as:

1. Check horizontal axis formula inside Select Data Source dialog box
2. Check Secondary Axis
3. Check linked Data Labels, Axis Labels, or Chart Title

### Method 5: Check Pivot Tables

To check Pivot Tables, follow these steps,

- Navigate to _PivotTable Tools > Analyze > Change Data Source > Change Data Source…_

![Edit links](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-Edit-Links-1024x84.png)

- Check if any of the formula used is problematic. Sometimes small typo, such as misplaced comma, can lead to such problems in Excel. Thus, check each formula thoroughly and correct the formulas wherever needed.

### Method 6: Use Excel Repair Software

When none of the methods resolve the error, then you can rely on advanced [Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), such as Stellar Repair for Excel. It’s a powerful tool that is recommended by several MVPs and IT administrators for resolving common Excel errors, such as ‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet.’

But sometimes, the restored version of the Excel file may not contain all the data or changes you made recently. In such cases, you are left with the option to repair the damaged or corrupt Excel file with the help of an Excel repair software, such as [Stellar Repair for Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## Solutions to Restore Excel File

Below we have discussed various solutions to repair, recover, and restore unsaved, lost, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel files with the help of MS Excel options and Excel repair software.

**_NOTE:_** _Some of these methods work only if you had enabled or configured certain required settings or options before corruption or losing the Excel file._

### 1\. Restore Lost or Unsaved Excel File via ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks’ Option

The _Recover Unsaved Workbooks_ option allows you to restore the Excel file that you forgot to save before closing MS Excel or it stopped working. The steps are as follows:

- Navigate to ‘_File > Open._’
- Scroll to the bottom and click on ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks.’ This opens a File Explorer browser window.

![recover unsaved excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/recover-unsaved-document.png)

- Now look for the Excel file that you lost and then double-click on it to open and restore the Excel file.
- Once the file is open, click on **File > Save As** and save it to your desired location.

However, this option works only if you had enabled and set up the ‘_Save AutoRecover information every X minutes_’ option and enabled the ‘_Keep the last AutoRecovered version if I close without saving’_ option.  

![change excel settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/change-settings-excel.png)

Also, this may not restore the most recent copy of your Excel file, but it will surely save your time that went into creating and editing the workbook.

### 2\. Repair and Restore Corrupt or Inaccessible Excel File

If the Excel file you are trying to open or access is corrupt, MS Excel will display an error message. When MS Excel detects corruption, it starts ‘File Recovery Mode’ to repair the Excel workbook.

However, if it doesn’t start automatically, you can manually repair minor corruption error and restore the Excel file by following these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Open** and then navigate to the corrupt or damaged Excel file location.
- Select the file and then click on the arrow beside the ‘**Open**’ button to choose the **‘Open and Repair…**’ option.

![open and repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/open-and-repair-excel-file.png)

- Now click ‘**Repair’** if you want to recover maximum data from a corrupt or inaccessible Excel workbook and restore it to a new Excel file.

![repair corrupt excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repair-corrupt-excel-sheet.png)

If the ‘**Repair’** option fails, use the Extract Data option that extracts values, data, and formulas from the Excel workbook.

### 3\. Revert Excel File to Last Saved Version

When an Excel file gets corrupt or damaged while working, you may revert the Excel file to the last saved version. This allows you to restore the Excel file version that isn’t corrupt or damaged. The steps are as follows,

- Click File > Open.
- Double-click the name of the workbook that you have opened in Excel.
- Click Yes to reopen the workbook.

The workbook opens without any changes you’ve made that might have caused the workbook to become corrupted.

### 4\. Use Excel Repair Software to Restore Excel File

If the corrupt or damaged Excel file isn’t repaired by using MS Excel options or you lost data after restoring the unsaved version or after reverting to the last version, you can rely on an Excel repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel.

The software repairs Excel files with 100% integrity and restores the Excel data, such as table, Pivot tables, charts, etc., while preserving the workbook properties and formatting. The software is safe as it doesn’t alter or make changes to the original Excel file and saves the repaired data to a new Excel workbook at your desired location.

It supports Excel files (XLS and XLSX), created in MS Excel 2019, 2016, or older versions. It resolves Excel corruption errors, such as Unable to open Excel file, in a few clicks.

To repair a corrupt or inaccessible Excel workbook by using Stellar Repair for Excel software, follow these 3 simple steps,

- Select the corrupt or damaged Excel workbook file (XLS/XLSX).

![stellar repair for excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/stellar-repair-for-Excel-choose-xls-xlsx-file.png)

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed methods and solutions to restore Excel file when it gets damaged or corrupt due to various issues.

Similar to any other program, you may experience problems with Microsoft Excel while opening or working on a document. Sometimes, it may not start at all or freeze and display an error message such as ‘Excel is not responding’. When it happens, you may want to wait for the program to respond.

![Microsoft Excel is not Responding ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Microsoft-Excel-not-responding.png)

Now, this could be disastrous if happens while you are working on an important Excel document that took you hours to prepare. Force closing Excel due to such error can damage the Excel document and it may fail to open next time.

## **Why Excel is Not Responding?**

Excel may stop responding, freeze, or crash suddenly due to several reasons. It can happen while saving a spreadsheet or opening an Excel document. It may also occur while editing or inserting images, graphs, etc. But usually, it occurs when the system crashes or shuts down abruptly while you are working on a document. Here’s an instance,

_Suppose, you worked overnight on a critical document which is to be presented at a meeting the next day. This Excel spreadsheet includes critical graphs and charts, and much more. When you are about to save it, there is a power failure, and your system shuts down without warning. When the power is up, you restarted the system to check your Excel. To your dismay, a message pops up – “Excel Crashed” or “Microsoft Excel not responding”._

This could be frustrating. However, there is no need to despair as there are solutions to not just overcome this error but other corresponding issues such as Excel freezing, hanging, crashing, etc. Below is an infographic that quickly briefs all the possible solutions to fix Excel not responding error.

## **Solutions to Fix ‘Microsoft Excel is not responding’ Error**

Follow the solutions discussed below in the given order to fix Excel freezing and hanging issues.

### **Solution 1**: **Open Excel in Safe Mode**

If Excel is not working as intended and frequently stops responding, you may try to start Excel in Safe Mode. It is a common DIY way to fix ‘Excel is not responding’ problem.

In Safe Mode, Excel starts with only essential services, bypasses certain functionalities and doesn’t load the add-ins, which might be the reason behind the error in MS Excel . To open and troubleshoot Excel in **Safe Mode**:

- Press **Windows + R** keys, type **excel.exe /safe and press ‘Enter’ or click ‘OK’**

![MS Excel in Safe Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Excel-safe-mode-1024x523.png)

MS Excel in Safe Mode

Open the Excel file and check if it still crashes. If not, the problem could be a faulty add-in or formatting and styling error.

Proceed to the next solution to check and fix the problem.

### **Solution 2: Check for Faulty and Unwanted Add-ins**

**In Microsoft Excel, there are two types of add-ins:**

- **COM add-ins**
- **Other Add-ins Installed as XLAM, XLA, or XLL File**

**Both types of add-ins can cause the freezing problem in Excel . Follow the steps below to disable unwanted and faulty add-ins:**

- In Excel , click **File and g**o to **Options** to open ‘**Excel Options**’ window
- Click **Add-ins** button to view and manage ‘**Microsoft Office Add-ins**’
- Uncheck required add-ins to disable them
- At this stage, you can also click the ‘**Remove**’ button to remove any unwanted add-ins

![Disable COM Add-Ins](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Remove-COM-Addins.jpg)

Disable COM Add-Ins

- Now enable an add-in and check the Excel performance. Observe Excel for not responding error or freezing problem

If Excel doesn’t freeze, enable subsequent add-in and then again use Excel to observe it. Repeat the steps until you find the faulty plugin, which is causing the problem.

Then remove it from Excel add-ins to resolve the problem.

### **Solution 3****:** **Install the latest Windows and Office Updates**

This problem may also occur if Windows and MS Office are not updated. Therefore, install the latest updates for both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office.

You can set the installation and update option to ‘**Automatic mode**’ in Windows. This will download and install critical updates for MS Office, which might fix the Excel performance issue. The steps to enable automatic updates are as follows:

1. Go to **Settings> Update & Security> Windows Update**

![Enable Automatic Windows updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/update-windows-1024x796.jpg)

Enable Automatic Windows updates

- Click **Advanced options** and enable all the toggle switches to automatically download and install updates for Windows and other Microsoft products

![Update Microsoft Products](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/upload-WIndows-Products-1024x796.jpg)

Update Microsoft Products

After update, restart Excel and check if the problem is resolved.

**_NOTE:_** _From now on, MS Excel will also get the latest update consistently, without the need for manual intervention._

### **Solution 4:  Check and Disable Anti-virus**

Antivirus is important for device safety. However, if your antivirus conflicts with MS Office apps such as Excel, it could lead to Excel freezing and not responding errors.

To check if the problem is due to anti-virus, disable it and reopen the Excel document. Check if Excel performs well or if it still hangs.

![Example of Antivirus conflict with Microsoft Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Antivirus.jpg)

Example of Antivirus conflict with Microsoft Excel

If the problem is resolved, contact your antivirus software provider for help to keep antivirus running without affecting the system and other programs such as MS Excel.

### **Solution 5: Change the ‘Default Printer’**

Although it may seem irrelevant, changing the default printer is another easy and effective solution to overcome the error. Reason being, Excel communicates with the printer to find supported margins when we open an Excel sheet.

If Excel doesn’t find the supported margin, it may stop responding or crash. The steps to change the default printer are as follows:

1. Open **Control Panel** on your Windows system
2. Click **Printer and Devices**
3. Right-click **Microsoft XPS Document Writer** to set it to the default printer

![Change in Default Printer Setting](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Default-Printer-Setting-1.jpg)

Change in Default Printer Setting

Reopen the Excel document to check whether the error occurs or not.

### **Solution 6: Repair Microsoft Office**

A corrupt or damaged Microsoft Office can also cause the ‘Excel is not responding’ problem. You can resolve this by repairing the Microsoft Office files. The steps are as follows:

1. **Close** all running MS Office programs
2. Go to **Control Panel** on your Windows system
3. Click **Programs** and then **Programs** **and** **Features**
4. Select **Microsoft Office** and in the Microsoft Office window, click ‘**Change**’
5. Then select the ‘**Repair**’ option and click ‘**Continue**’

![Repair MS Office](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Repair-MS-Office.jpg)

Repair MS Office

This may take a while. After the repair is done, check your Excel program and file for the error.

### **Solution 7: Remove and Reinstall Microsoft Office**

Sometimes, repairing MS Office may not work. In such a case, removing and reinstalling Microsoft Office can resolve the ‘Excel is not responding’ problem. To do so, follow these steps:

1. **Close** all running MS Office programs
2. Go to **Control Panel** on your Windows system
3. Click **Programs** and then **Programs** **and** **Features**
4. Right-click on **Microsoft Office** and choose **Uninstall**

![ Uninstall MS Office](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Uninstall-MS-Office.jpg)

Uninstall MS Office

Then run the MS Office installation setup to re-install MS Office on your system.

You can run the [compatibility checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-an-excel-workbook-for-compatibility-with-earlier-versions-of-excel-169a0336-965b-4430-8554-4e7b5db79947) to review the compatibility issues in your Excel file. If this is not the issue, then follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Review VBA Code

The exception from hresult 0x800a03ec excel can occur if you are trying to execute incorrect or incomplete queries in the Excel VBA code. It can also appear if the formulas do not contain the equal (=) symbol at the beginning. Verify the VBA code for any logical flaws, typo errors, syntax errors, or missing references.

### Method 2: Check the Field Size

Excel has certain [limits and specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). If the Excel file’s data exceeds these designated size limits, you can get the MS Excel error code 0x800A03EC error. For example, this error occurs if you try to export a file with more rows than the limit of 65536 and columns than the limit of 256. Check and optimize the file size by minimizing complex formulas and other objects.

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

Sometimes, disabled items in Add-ins settings can prevent macros from functioning correctly. You can check and enable the disabled items in Add-ins using these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Options**.

![Go To Options Tab](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-options-tab.jpg)

- You will see a list of disabled items.
- Click on the disabled items and then click **Enable**.
- Restart Excel for the applied changes to take effect.

- In MS Excel, go to **File > Options > Trust Center**.

![Click Trust Center Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-trust-center-option.jpg)

- Select **Enable all macros** and click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the OLE Objects

The Microsoft Excel error code 0x800A03EC can also appear if there is a connection disruption in the VBA. Such an issue can occur if there is an issue with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) in an Excel workbook. The OLE objects are linked to external files. You can check and remove the unnecessary OLE objects from your Excel file to fix the issue.

### Method 6: Check Methods in VBA

Excel can throw the “Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC” error if you are trying to call an invalid method in a VBA code. Many users have reported this issue when trying to use ‘copy and paste’ feature using copy paste special [method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.pastespecial) (range.pastespecial) in Excel. Paste special is an advanced option in Excel to smooth the copy-and-paste task. While using this method, the exception can usually occur when Excel application detects an invalid or misaligned range or mismatch data type in the syntax. To fix this, check the syntax of the paste special method.

### Method 7: Repair your Excel File

Corruption in Excel file can create inconsistencies in the macro and lead to the “Exception from HRESULT 0x800a03ec Excel” error. In such a case, you can try repairing the Excel file using Microsoft’s inbuilt utility – Open and Repair. To use this utility, follow these steps:

## How to Fix Excel File Couldn't Open in Protected View

**Summary:** This blog discusses about the Excel error 'The file couldn't open in Protected View' and workarounds to fix the error. If you cannot access the Excel file data, using an Excel file repair tool can help you quickly restore the data to its original state.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Protected View is a feature in Microsoft Excel that opens a file in read-only mode while disabling the editing functions. An Excel file opens in Protected View if the file is from an unsafe location. For example, the file may be opened from an insecure Internet location or downloaded as an Outlook attachment from suspicious senders. In that case, your Excel application won’t let you open the file to protect it against malware or virus attacks.

However, the Protected View feature sometimes prevents an Excel file from opening even if it is from a safe location. Also, opening an Excel file may return an error message ‘file couldn’t open in protected view’.

![the file couldn't open in Protected View excel error](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/file-couldnt-open-in-protected-view-error-1.png)

You may be able to resolve the issue by closing all the open Excel files, closing the Excel application, and then re-opening the problematic file. But this process can take a significant amount of time as you need to close and re-open the Excel application and the file continuously.

## **How to Fix the Excel File Couldn’t Open in Protected View Error?**

Here are some workarounds to fix the error:

### **Workaround 1 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

**Note:** Before disabling the protected view settings, ensure you have a reliable antivirus software installed on your computer to safeguard files against malware or virus attacks.

- Open the Excel file throwing the error, go to **File** and click the **Options** tab.
- From the Options dialog box, go to **Trust Center** and click on **Trust Center Settings**.
- From the Trust Center Settings dialog box, select the **Protected View** tab.
- Uncheck the appropriate option under the Protected View section, and then click **OK** to apply the changes. For instance, uncheck the “Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments” option if the file is a downloaded Outlook attachment.

![disable protected view settings ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/disable-protected-view-2.png)

- Click **OK** again.

Now try opening the problematic Excel file. If it still doesn’t open, try the following workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Repair the Office Installation**

Sometimes, corruption in the Office installation may cause Excel to return the ‘file could not open in protected view’ error. So, try repairing your Office installation and check if it solves the problem.

- Open the Control Panel and click the **Uninstall a program** option under **Programs**.
- Click **Uninstall a program** under the **Programs** tab.
- Right-click the Microsoft Office program you have installed and click the **Change** button.
- Select the **Repair** option and click **Continue**.

![repair office program](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/online-repair-microsoft-office-app-3-1024x387.png)

Once the repair operation is complete, check if you can open the Excel file without any issue.

### **Workaround 3 – Install Latest MS Office Updates**

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing [issues](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54) (such as the Protected View issue) on opening an Office document like Excel, Word, or others – after upgrading Windows to a newer version. This problem may occur due to incompatibility between the Office app and the updated Windows version. You can try to fix the problem by upgrading the Office app, and here’s how:

- Click on the **File** tab in the Excel file that throws an error.
- Click the **Account** tab at the left-hand bottom of the screen.
- From Office Updates, expand **Update Options**, and then click **Update Now**.

![office updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/update-excel-4.png)

After installing the updates, restart your PC and open the Excel file. If this doesn’t work, use the following workaround.

## **Workaround 4 – Convert the File and Rename It**

Some Excel users resolved the ‘Protected view’ issue by renaming their Excel files. But before that, ensure that the file you are trying to open is saved with .xlsx format. If the file type is .xls, you need to convert it to .xlsx format and then rename it. Before converting the file, save a copy of the original file in the desired location.

If the file type is .xlsx, copy the problematic file. Next, open a blank Excel document and paste the copied file. The file will appear as an icon, double-click on it. If it opens without any error, save it with a different name. Hopefully, reaming the Excel file may help resolve the problem.

## **Conclusion**

There is no fixed solution to resolve the Excel error ‘The file could not open in Protected View’. However, the workarounds discussed in the blog have helped users resolve the ‘Protected View’ issue. Make sure to use the workarounds in the same order as explained in the blog.

If you’re having an issue loading the Excel file data due to the ‘Protected View’ error, consider restoring the data using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
