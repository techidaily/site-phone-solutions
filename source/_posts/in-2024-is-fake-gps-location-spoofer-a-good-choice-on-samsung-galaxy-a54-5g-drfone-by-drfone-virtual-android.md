## Part 4: Fake GPS Location Spoofer User Reviews

To clarify the credibility of the **Fake GPS Location Spoofer app**, we also took our time to check what other users are saying.

Here, we've summarized some of the top reviews from real users on Playstore.

| **Platform** | **User** | **Remarks** | **Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _The company updates the app, in their own words, fixes the bug, and then expects you to pay again and again and again. Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with "routes' ' or "joystick" added. I wouldn't mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn't. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn't working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn't have import & export or a joystick. Import & export wouldn't be important if reliable._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | Douglas Buell | _This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the "no ads' ' mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I'm immediately shown an ad the instant I've clicked the message "Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!" Why include a feature that doesn't work? To force us to watch an ad you didn't have to work for? Ridiculous._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It's not difficult, but My Samsung Galaxy A54 5G keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won't be using google maps, set it up there, and you're all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works._ | 4.0/5.0 |
