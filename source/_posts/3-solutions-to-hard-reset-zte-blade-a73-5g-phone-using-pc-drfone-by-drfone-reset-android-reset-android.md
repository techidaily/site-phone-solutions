- **Step 1: Press Power off + home button.**

Press the power button until the options for Power off, Restart, and others appear. Now, tap on the “Power off” option and hold on to it while pressing the home button of your android device at the same time.

- **Step 2: Confirm boot into safe mode.**

Now, the screen for rebooting into safe mode will appear. Tap on “Yes” to enter the safe mode.

- **Step 3: Enter recovery mode.**

Press and hold the power button as well as the home button of your device simultaneously until a new screen appears. After it appears, release the two buttons and press the power button one more time. Now, press and hold down the home button. With that, you will enter into recovery mode and a new set of options will appear on the screen.

- **Step 4: Navigate and do Factory Reset.**

Using the home button to navigate, move down to the “Wipe data/factory reset” option. Press the power button to select the option.

## Part 3: Reset Android with the reset pinhole

There are many reasons for opting to reset an Android smartphone or tablet. Sometimes, a forgotten password might get your tablet locked. At times, the screen of your smartphone or tablet might get stuck and fail to respond. Or your device might come with a non-removable battery to make matters worse. For all these problems and many others, you might want to reset your device. But if your device does not come with a home button or volume buttons, you might want to use a different method. Generally, such devices come with a reset pinhole on the ZTE Blade A73 5G device which can be used to reset the ZTE Blade A73 5G device. To perform a tablet hard reset without the volume button, follow the simple steps described below.

![choose yes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14931910627827.jpg)

- **Step 1: Find the Reset pinhole.**

Look for a very small opening on the back panel or the bezels of a smartphone. Usually, such pinholes are marked “Reset” or “Reboot” and are available on the top left side of the back panel. But be careful not to mistake it with the microphone as using it for resetting your gadget may damage the small microphone permanently and lead to other complications.

- **Step 2: Insert a pin into the hole.**

After locating it, insert a stretched paperclip or a small pin into the hole and press it for a few seconds.

Now all the data in your Android device will be reset. After this, you can continue to use your device normally without any problem.

## Part 4: Reset Android from Settings (phone works normally)

If your Android tablet or smartphone is functioning normally, your device can be reset to the factory settings using just your device itself. Even if your device does not have a home button or volume control buttons, this method will be applicable and can be used to reset the ZTE Blade A73 5G device. But before using this method to reset your Android device, make sure to back up all the necessary information that you have on your device. You can also sync all the important files to the cloud using your Google account. Also, it is necessary to keep in mind that this procedure will remove all the accounts into which your device is signed in. To know how to reset an Android tablet without volume button, read on.

- **Step 1: Open the Settings app.**

Tap on the Settings app in the app section of your device to open it.

- **Step 2: Select the Data Reset folder.**

After that, navigate or scroll down until you can find the “Backup and Reset” option. Tap on it to open the folder.

![select the data reset folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14931914941646.jpg)

- **Step 3: Tap on Factory data reset.**

Now swipe down to find the “Factory data reset” option and tap on it. A new screen will appear, requesting you for confirmation to proceed with the process. Tap on “Reset device” to start the process.

![backup reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14931915614133.jpg)

At the end of the process, your device will be reset and ready to use after it completes the mandatory reboot.
