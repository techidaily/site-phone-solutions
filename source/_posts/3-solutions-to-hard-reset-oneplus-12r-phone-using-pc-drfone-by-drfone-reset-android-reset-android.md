## Using OnePlus 12R Hard Reset in What Situations?

When your phone runs out of storage, you can only delete the previous data if you want to save something new. Although OnePlus 12R phones provide a lot of storage and support SD cards, you can only erase unwanted data if you run out of space. Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an **OnePlus 12R hard reset**. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.

### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don't like an update's new features and settings.

In another scenario, let's say your phone is stolen or you lost it. All you need to do is use the **OnePlus 12R hard reset** to ensure no one can access your personal data.

- Power off your mobile phone.
