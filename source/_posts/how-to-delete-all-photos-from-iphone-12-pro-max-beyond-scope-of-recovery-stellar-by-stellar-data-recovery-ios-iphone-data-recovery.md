Are you planning to sell or discard your iPhone? If yes, it’s important to ensure that your personal data, such as photos and videos, etc. is deleted and cannot be recovered even by a professional data recovery tool. To protect your privacy and prevent unauthorized access to your deleted iPhone photos, make sure your iPhone is wiped clean of all your previous photos before you sell, donate, or discard it.  

In this blog, we will talk about different ways to delete photos from iPhones beyond the scope of recovery.

## **How to Delete All Photos from iPhone?**

Before deleting all photos from the iPhone, it’s important to take a backup of all photos to avoid any accidental data loss situation. There are various ways to back up your iPhone photos:

### **1\. iCloud**

Use iCloud to back up all your photos automatically. To sync iCloud with Photos –

- Go to **Settings** > \[**your** **name**\] > **iCloud** > **Photos**, and turn on **iCloud** **Photos**.

![sync iCloud with Photos](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sync-icloud-with-photos.jpg)

Your photos will be backed up to iCloud automatically if your device has enough storage space and is connected to Wi-Fi.

### **2\. iTunes:**

You can even use iTunes to back up your iPhone photos. To do this,

- Connect your **iPhone** to your system.
- Launch **iTunes** and then select your **device**.
- Click **Summary** > “**Back Up Now**” to create a backup of all your data, including photos.

![sync Photos with iTunes](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sync-photos-with-iTunes.jpg)

Once you have backed up all your photos, proceed forward with deleting them from your iPhone.

## **Method 1: Delete Images From Photos and Recently Deleted Folder**

Photos app saves images shot from iPhone as well as those received on chats. You can delete all the photos from your iPhone via the Photos app. Here’s how to do it.

- Open the **Photos** app on your iPhone.
- Go to the **Library** tab, tap **All** **Photos**, and then tap **Select**.
- Select **one** or **multiple** photos you want to delete.
- Tap on the **Trash** icon and then confirm to **delete** the photos.

![delete photos from iPhone](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/delete-photos-from-iphone.jpg)

When you delete a photo from the iPhone, it’s not deleted permanently. Instead, it is moved to the **Recently Deleted** folder, where the deleted photos stay for 30 days before being permanently deleted.

**To permanently delete photos from the Recently Deleted folder, follow these steps:**

- Open the **Photos** app > **Albums**.
- Scroll down, then tap on **Recently** **Deleted**.
- Next, tap **Select** and choose the photos that you want to delete permanently.
- Tap **Delete** and then confirm to delete the photos.

![delete photos from Recently Deleted folder](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/delete-photos-from-recently-deleted-folder.jpg)

Remember, if iCloud sync is enabled, photos deleted from iPhone will be deleted on iCloud. That is why if you want to delete photos from your iPhone but not on iCloud, make sure iCloud sync is disabled for Photos.

## **Method 2: Factory Reset Your iPhone**

Apple’s brilliant feature of the **‘Erase All Content and Settings’** option brings your device to default settings by erasing all your iPhone data, etc.

The factory reset will delete all the settings, photos, audio, videos, messages, notes, call history, search history, app history, passcodes, and any other data on your iPhone.

However, remember erasing your iPhone data with the **‘Erase All Content and Settings’** doesn’t delete your data permanently. It means that all your iPhone data including photos are still recoverable with the help of robust [iPhone data recovery software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/).

**Steps to Factory Reset iPhone**

- Open **Settings** on your iPhone.
- Go to **General** and tap on **Transfer** **or** **Reset** **iPhone**.
- Click on the **Erase All Content and Settings** options.
- Click **Continue** and enter your iPhone **passcode**.
