## Conclusion

So these are the methods with which you can do a reset without using volume buttons. The difficulty level of the methods depends on the type and brand of the Android device. The first two parts can be performed easily by anyone, and that too in a matter of a few minutes. However, the third method may pose some difficulty, particularly because manufacturers set different key combinations for rebooting the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device into recovery. Nevertheless, once it is figured out, the rest is easy. Hence, it is up to you to decide on the method to be adopted for hard resetting your Android device.
