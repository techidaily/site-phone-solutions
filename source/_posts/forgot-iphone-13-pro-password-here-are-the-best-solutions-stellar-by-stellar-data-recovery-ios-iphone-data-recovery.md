Minor changes in the iPhone Settings can also help restore deleted contacts. Try the below Setting changes and check if they work for you:

- Change Contacts’ Groups Settings
- Reset the Network Connections
- Change Default Account in Settings back to iCloud (works for iPhone 8/7/6s)

### **1: Change Contacts’ Groups Settings**

- Go to your **Contacts,** tap into **Groups**
-  Uncheck **All iCloud**
- Select **All on iPhone**

![Change Contacts' groups settings](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/123-1.jpg)

- Click on **Done** (top right)
- Check if you got back all your contacts

### **2: Reset the Network Connections**

- Under **Settings** > **General** > **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings**

![Reset iPhone Network Connections](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/main-qimg-164d17fa45a35b970a0c4651fa2c690a.png)

- Enter your passcode
- Choose **Reset Network Settings** to continue ignoring the message that this action will delete all your network settings.

This action will clear your current saved networks and Wi-Fi passwords, but you can always re-enter your network passwords later. So give this a try to retrieve lost contacts.

### **3: Change Default Account in Settings back to iCloud (works for iPhone 14, 13, 12, 11, X, 8, 7, 6)**

![Restore Contacts through iPhone Settings](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/iphone-settings2.png)

- Go to your iPhone **Settings** > **Mail, Contacts, Calendars** > **Contacts**
- Click **Default Account**
- Select **iCloud** instead of **On my iPhone**
- Check if your phone’s missing contacts recovered
