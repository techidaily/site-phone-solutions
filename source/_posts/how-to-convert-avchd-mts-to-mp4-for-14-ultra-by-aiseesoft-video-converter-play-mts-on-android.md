    Wanna watch MTS clips copied from your AVCHD camera on Xiaomi 14 Ultra? AVCHD is a popular file-based format for digital recording and playback of high-definition video. Most Android phones or tablets lack native support for AVCHD MTS footage. You can either use a third party media player like VLC or MX player to play MTS files on your Xiaomi 14 Ultra, or convert AVCHD footage to MP4 format that is well compatible with Xiaomi 14 Ultra.
