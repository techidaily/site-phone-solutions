    My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro? I would really appreciate any help."
