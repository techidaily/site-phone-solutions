## How To Use Special Features  - Virtual Location On Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+?

Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes with multiple unique features that can be used to enhance the flow of spoofing location. With all these amazing features, you can easily change your iOS location without blinking an eye. Rather than making things complicated, Dr.Fone makes it easy for you to manage operations when you perform actions like changing Android locations.

### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

![apply fluctuation mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png)

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Step 2Import a GPX File

For importing a GPX file on the platform, click the **Import** button on the right pane. As this opens a window, select the GPX file you wish to import to the platform.

![import gpx file to the platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Step 3Wait for the File to be Read

Wait for a moment until Dr.Fone - Virtual Location recognizes the specific locations within the GPX file and displays them on the map.

![wait for gpx file to load](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

### Part 6: Historical Records

If you want to use a similar track record on your smartphone again, you can access the historical records saved on the platform for easy access.

Step 1Open Historical Records

Click the **Historical Records** button on the right pane to access the entire history involving the connected smartphone and the location spoofing platform.

![access historical records](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-1.png)

Step 2Access Any Location from the History

Select the **Go** button adjacent to any particular historical record to re-launch a similar simulation for the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. You can also click **Clear All** to delete all historical records.

![move to any location from history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-2.png)

### Part 7: Favorite List

You can also set up favorite locations within the platform to define quick accessibility to your favorite locations. To do that, you have to follow the guidelines shown next:

Step 1Favorite Specific Locations

While setting up locations in Jump Teleport Mode, One-Stop Route, or Multi-Stop Route, you can tap on the **Favorite** icon adjacent to every marked location or favorite an entire route with the **Favorite** icon on the top of the left panel.

![save locations as favorite](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/find-favorites.png)

Step 2Access your Favorite Section

To look for your favorite locations, look for the **Favorite** icon on the right pane to open a list containing all locations you have marked. You can choose the **Move** option to automatically move into a particular location in no time.

![search for favorite locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/search-favorites.png)

## Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+?

Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.

![pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg)

Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of "catching them all."

'Spoofing' location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you're in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.

## **Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?**

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo's Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.

So, ****is PGSharp legal?**** No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.

 According to Niantic's terms and conditions:

- "Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device's location (for example through GPS spoofing).
- And _"_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software)."

 If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.

- The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.
- The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.
- The third strike will permanently ban your account.

 You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you've been banned without violation of any terms.

## ****Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android****

1. **PGSharp :**

![pgsharp-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg)

PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.

****Note:**** It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.

- To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google's "Play store," search "PGSharp," and install it.
- After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.
- For the paid key, visit PGSharp's official website and generate a license key.

You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an "out of stock." message.

- After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.

****Note:**** You may need to allow "Mock location" from debugging options. For this, go to "Settings," then to "About Phone," then you need to tap on "Build number" seven times to enable developer's mode, and finally go to "Debugging" to allow "Mock location."

2. ****Fake GPS Go:****

![fake gps go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg)

Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world. This is one of the easiest solutions to playing Pokémon   Go while spoofing location without getting detected with its real-map-like UI. Moreover, this app does not even require root access.

- To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google's "Play store," search "Fake GPS Go," and install it.
- Then, go to your phone's "Settings" and then "System" followed by "About Phone," and tap on the "Build Number" 7 times to enable the Developer Options.
- Then you need to go to "Debugging" in "Developers Options" to allow "Mock location."
- And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.

3. **VPN:**

![vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.

Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.

- To install a VPN, go to Google's "Play store," search the VPN of your choice and install it.
- Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.
- Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.

****Note:**** Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data. Hence, selecting a good VPN app is imperative, which will spoof GPS location and data encryption.

You can use both VPNs (which do not spoof GPS location themselves) and the Fake location app simultaneously for extra reliability.

## ****Part 3: Best way to spoof on iOS – dr.fone Virtual Location****

Spoofing the GPS location on iPhones is more difficult and much more complex than it is on Android. However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.

Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select "Virtual Location" given on the first page of the program.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select "Get Started". Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3: Enable the "teleport mode" by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone's GPS to in the text box in the map's left-upper section. Select "Go".

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4: Now select "Move here." And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.

****Pro-Tips:****

- Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.
- Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.
- Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)
- After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.
- Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.
- Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.

Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who's on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.
