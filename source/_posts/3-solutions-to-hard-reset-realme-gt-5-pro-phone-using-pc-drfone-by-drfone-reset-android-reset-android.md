## Part 4: Hard reset Android using Android Device Manager (Find My Device)

When someone loses their phone, or it is stolen, the two questions that commonly arise are: how to locate the phone? And if it is not possible, how to remotely wipe the phone’s data?

## The Bottom Line

So these were the third different methods through which you can hard reset your Android device. Resetting the Realme GT 5 Pro device involves removing every data from the Realme GT 5 Pro device. The phone gets back to the same state as it was out of the box. Hence, most importantly, do not forget to back up data using Phone Backup and restore beforehand so that you do not end up losing anything important.



## How to Reset Realme GT 5 Pro without Losing Data

Nothing good lasts forever, not even your all-singing, all-dancing new Android smartphone. The warning signs are obvious, apps taking forever to load, constant force close notifications, and a battery life shorter than an episode of Westworld. If you recognize these symptoms then listen up, because your phone may be headed for a meltdown and there's only one thing left to do. It's time to reset your Android phone.

Before taking the plunge, there are a number of factors to consider. We've put together a quick guide to let you know what you need to know... and what you need to do. Before we start deleting stuff, however, it's important to understand what a Factory reset is.

## Part 1: What is Factory Reset?

There are two types of reset for every Android device, soft and hard resets. A [soft reset](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) is just a way to force the Android operating system to shut down in the event of a freeze and you only risk losing any data which wasn't saved prior to the reset.

A hard reset, also known as a factory reset and a master reset, returns the Realme GT 5 Pro device to the condition it was in when it left the factory. Performing a factory reset will permanently delete any and all personal data you have on your device. This includes any personal settings, apps, pictures, documents, and music stored on your device. A factory reset is irreversible, which means before considering taking this step, it is a good idea to back your data and settings up. A factory reset is a great way to purge buggy updates and other malfunctioning software and can give your phone a new lease of life.

![facotry reset android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-factory-reset-01.jpg)

### Signs You Need to Reset Phone

You'll probably already know if your phone needs a reset, but if you're unsure, look for some of the following signs. If you recognize any of the following symptoms then a factory reset is probably a good idea.

1. If your [phone is running slowly](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/android-phone-slow.html) and you've already tried deleting Apps and data, but it hasn't resolved anything.
2. If your [Apps are crashing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/apps-keeps-crashing-android.html) or you keep getting 'force close' notifications from your operating system.
3. If your Apps are taking longer to load than usual, or your browser is running slow.
4. If you find your battery life is worse than usual and you need to charge your phone more often.
5. If you are selling, exchanging, or just giving your phone away. If you don’t reset it, the new user can gain access to cached passwords, personal details, and even your pictures and videos.

Remember factory resetting will erase everything on your device, so it's essential that you back up anything you can't afford to lose.

## Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset

There are a number of Android data backup software for PC out there. Having a Google account will help you save your contacts and settings, but it won't save your pictures, documents, or music. There are numerous cloud-based systems available like Dropbox and Onedrive where your data is saved onto a cloud-based server, but you'll need a data connection or wi-fi to restore to your device and of course, you are trusting a third party with your data. We recommend [Dr.Fone Basic](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). It's easy to use and will save everything and best of all you know exactly where it is.

## Conclusion

So these are the methods with which you can do a reset without using volume buttons. The difficulty level of the methods depends on the type and brand of the Android device. The first two parts can be performed easily by anyone, and that too in a matter of a few minutes. However, the third method may pose some difficulty, particularly because manufacturers set different key combinations for rebooting the Realme GT 5 Pro device into recovery. Nevertheless, once it is figured out, the rest is easy. Hence, it is up to you to decide on the method to be adopted for hard resetting your Android device.
