Beyond that, you don’t want anyone who dares to steal your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro to get full access to your mails, pictures or other sensitive data. But what if you’re the one who cannot access your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro? You could forget your PIN or pattern, right? Or someone pranks you by setting up a lock screen pattern and just leaves you struggling with it.
