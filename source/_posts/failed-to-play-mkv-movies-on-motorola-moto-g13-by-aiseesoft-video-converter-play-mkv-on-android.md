    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Motorola Moto G13 plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Motorola Moto G13.

    Because MKV isn’t an industry standard, not all portable devices support it - even though support has grown rapidly. You have two main options for playing MKV files on Motorola Moto G13: using an MKV compatible media player with appropriate codecs installed （e.g VLC player, MX Player）, or converting MKV files to the widely supported H.264 MP4 format if the first option doesn’t work. Check a quick guide on how to encode MKV files to H.264 MP4 for Motorola Moto G13 playback.
