      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi A2+ first. That’s where an HEVC to Xiaomi Redmi A2+ converter comes in.
