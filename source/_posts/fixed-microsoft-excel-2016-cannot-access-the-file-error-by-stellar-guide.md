You may experience the “Microsoft Excel cannot access the file” error when saving the Excel file. This happens when the Excel application fails to read the file you are attempting to save. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the file name or its path. Sometimes, the error occurs if the file you are trying to access is already in use by another application. Some other reasons for the “Excel cannot access the file” error are:

- Faulty or incompatible Excel add-ins.

## **Methods to Fix “Microsoft Excel Cannot Access the File” Error**

Sometimes, changing the file location can fix the “Microsoft Excel cannot access the file” error. You can try changing the file location, if the location is incorrect. If moving the file to a different location didn’t work, then try the below troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check the File Name and Path**

You can get the “Microsoft Excel cannot access file” error if there is an issue with the file path – either the path does not exist or it is too lengthy, thus creating conflicts. Make sure the file path is correct. If the file name is too long, you can rename the file with a short name and also move the file to the parent folder instead of a subfolder. After that, remove the file from the **Recent** list that is created by Excel based on your recent activity. Follow the below steps:

- Open the Excel application.
- In the **Recent list**, right-click on the affected Excel file.
- Now, select **Remove from list**.

- Close the Excel application.

Now, reopen the problematic file and check if the error exists. If yes, then follow the next solution.

### **Method 2: Try Clearing the Microsoft Office Cache**

Sometimes, clearing the Microsoft Office cache can help eliminate the “Excel cannot access the file” error. To clear the Microsoft Office cache, follow the given steps:

- First, close all the Office applications.
- Press **Windows+R** to open the **Run** window.
- Type %localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\OfficeFileCache and press the **Enter** key. You can change ‘16.0’ with your Office version.

- Click **Protected View** from the left pane in the **Trust Center Settings** window.
- Unselect the options under **Protected View**. Click **OK.**

### **Method 5: Check and Disable Add-ins**

To check if the error has occurred due to some faulty add-ins, open the application in **safe mode** (press Windows + R and typeexcel /safe in the Run window**)**.

- Open your Excel application and go to **File > Options.**

- In **Excel Options**, select **Trust Center** and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
- In Trust Center Settings, click **Add-ins** and thenselect “**Disable all applications Add-ins”.** Click **OK.**

- In the **Security** window, select the **user names** under **‘Group or users name’**.
- Check the file permissions and make sure the write option is enabled. If not, then grant the permission. Click **Apply** and then **OK.**
