## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone 15 Plus 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Bypassing Activation Lock with a Professional Tool

For iPhone 5S to iPhone 15 Plus users who prefer an easier way to remove Activation Lock, `Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)` is a suitable option.

Dr.Fone is a set of modules that cater to a myriad of requirements that phone users can have from time to time, and one of them is the need to be able to disable the Activation Lock for Apple devices when the need arises. A need never arises in our wildest dreams, until it does, at the most inopportune time. It has, hasn't it?

This option is best for when you want to see/ recover some data from the device that you would otherwise lose.



## Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (iPhone 15 Plus)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone 15 Plus but forgot to erase the device before submitting and consequently, the device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that iPhone 15 Plus to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

Disabling Activation Lock on iPhone 15 Plus is easy if you have the Apple ID credentials that are associated with the iPhone 15 Plus.

![Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the device to factory settings.
- **Step 2**: When you set up the device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the device. Do that and you are golden!

### Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the device and removing the device from the associated iCloud account.

- **Step 1**: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at [https://icloud.com](https://secure.2checkout.com/order/cart.php?PRODS=4719741&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875).
- **Step 2**: Sign In and go to `Find iPhone`.

![Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/2.avif)

- **Step 3**: Click All Devices and select the device that was sold to the user.
- **Step 4**: Click Erase iPhone and if the device is still there after the erase is complete, click Remove From Account.

![Erase iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/3.avif)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the iPhone in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the iPhone and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/4.avif)

- **Step 1**: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- **Step 2**: Select Devices under Intune.
- **Step 3**: Select All Devices.
- **Step 4**: Locate the device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- **Step 5**: Under the Overview pane of the device, select Wipe.
- **Step 6**: When the device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

The device will be reset, and employees can set it up again with a new Apple ID.

The apps you had on your iPhone 15 Plus prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the device again.


## Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Plus Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Plus. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your iPhone.

- **Step 1**: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac.

![Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-a-disabled-iphone/6.avif)

- **Step 2**: Select your disabled iPhone 15 Plus from the devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled iPhone 15 Plus and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.


## Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Plus Without A Computer

here are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled iPhone 15 Plus with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Plus or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Plus.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Plus and return the device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled iPhone 15 Plus is using third-party tools such as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 15 Plus with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.



## Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/2.avif)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your iPhone 15 Plus would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.
