### Method 2: Change location in Google Maps with a VPN

An array of VPN apps come with built-in location spoofing features on top of the usual IP address masking. For example,

### 1\. Nord VPN

NordVPN includes additional features to stay ahead of Hulu’s VPN blocks. It has a Smart DNS tool, to unblock streaming apps on games consoles and Smart TVs, and a functional app for Amazon Fire TV, too, though, it isn’t quite as fast as ExpressVPN, but it’s more than fast enough for HD streaming.

**Pros**

- Affordable price tag
- Useful Smart DNS feature
- IP and DNS leak protection

**Cons**

- Speed Slower than ExpressVPN
- Only one Japan server location
- Unable to pay by PayPal

### 2\. ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN can bypasses many streaming blocks, like Hulu’s, and it delivers a fast long-distance speeds connecting to America from overseas compared to other vpns. Also, it provides many Japanese server locations, including the main big cities in Japan, Tokyo and Osaka.

**Pros**

- Fast speed
- In-built DNS and IPv6 leak protection
- Smart DNS tool
- 14 US cities and 3 Janpanese location severs

**Cons**

- More expensive than other VPN providers

### 3\. Surfshark

Surfshark is relatively new to the market and only emerged some time back in 2018. It’s available now at a great price compared to current top dogs in the market.

**Pros**

- Affordable price tag
- Safe & private connection
- Smooth user experience

**Cons**

- Weak social media connection
- New to industry, unstable for sometime

VPNs change your perceived location by swapping out your real IP address with that of the VPN server. IP addresses are unique sequences of numbers and decimals that identify every device on the internet. An IP address can be used to approximate a device’s location.

**Step-by-step guide for faking location in Google Maps with a VPN**

No matter what VPNs you are using, the steps are basically as same as the following:

- Open a VPN app on your phone.
- Choose a country IP address that you hope to change to.
- Switch the button to make a connection on VPN.
- Refresh or reopen your Google Map, and then input your desired location on its search section.
- It's complished when the desired location is found.
