You can use the Filter function in Excel to filter data in large-sized Excel files quickly. While using Excel filters, sometimes, you face a situation where the filter is disabled or may fail to function properly.

![Filter Option Disabled](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/filter-option-disabled-1024x112.jpg)

The Excel filter usually fails to work if you have not selected the complete and correct range of data. Let’s learn more about the “Sort and Filter not working in Excel” issue and look at the possible methods to fix it.

## **Why the Filter is not Working in Excel?**

You can face the “filter is not working” issue if you are applying the filter on a protected worksheet or trying to find the data from a hidden row. Besides this, there could be many other reasons contributing to this issue, such as:

- The data you are trying to filter is in merged cells.
- The Excel file automatically selected the data up to the first empty cell, excluding the remaining rows.
- Grouped sheets in Excel file.
- Blank row in the Excel sheet.
- You are trying to apply a filter on an invalid data range.
- The workbooks in which you’re facing the filter issues are corrupted.
- You are specifying incorrect criteria in the filter columns.

## **Solutions to Resolve the Filter is not Working Issue in Excel**

There might be two scenarios: the Excel filter option is disabled/grayed out or the filters fail to function properly. You can follow the given troubleshooting solutions to resolve the issue based on the scenario you’re facing.

## **Scenario 1 – Filter Option is Disabled or Grayed Out**

### **Method 1: Check and Un-group the Worksheet**

When you apply filters to a single sheet in a grouped set, Excel disables the filter option in other sheets within the group. You can check the grouped sheets and try ungrouping them to enable the filter option. Here’s how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Group** section.

![Excel file navigation: Accessing the Group section
](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-group-section-1024x114.jpg)

- Right-click on the **Ungroup Sheets.**

Alternatively, you can press the Shift + Alt + Left keys to ungroup the sheets.

### **Method 2: Unprotect Worksheet**

The “disabled Excel filter” issue can also occur if your worksheet is protected. You can unprotect the worksheet to enable the filter option. To do so, go to the **Review** tab and then select **Unprotect Sheet.**

![Excel file: Navigating to Group section, resolving 'disabled Excel filter' issue with worksheet protection, unprotecting sheet from Review tab for filter activation.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-review-and-select-unprotect-sheet-1024x115.jpg)

### **Method 3: Check and Uninstall Excel Add-ins**

Sometimes, the Excel filter gets disabled due to faulty or corrupted Excel add-ins. You can run the Excel in Safe mode to check whether the issue has occurred due to add-ins. To do this, type excel /safe in the Run window and click **OK.**

![Troubleshooting disabled Excel filter caused by add-ins: Running Excel in Safe mode with 'excel /safe' in Run window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/type-excel-safe-command.jpg)

In safe mode, if you see the filter option, it indicates some problematic Excel add-ins were causing the issue. In such a case, you can check and uninstall the faulty Excel add-ins to fix the issue.

## **Scenario 2 – Filter is not Working**

### **Method 1: Try Clearing Filters**

Sometimes, the Excel filter fails to work correctly if some filters from the previous sessions are still active. In such a case, you can clear the applied filters. Follow the below steps:

- In Excel file, click Sort & Filter option.
- Select clear.

![Excel: Clicking 'Sort & Filter' and selecting 'Clear' option.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-clear-option.jpg)

### **Method 2: Select Entire Data**

The filter not working issue in Excel can occur when the range selected for filtering is incomplete or incorrect. You need to make sure that you’ve selected the entire data range in Excel. You can use the Ctrl+A keys to select the entire content in the worksheet.

### **Method 3: Check and Delete Blank Cells from the Table’s Columns**

When you apply a filter to the data, Excel expects data to be in a continuous range. Excel filters do not consider the blank cells, thereby resulting in incorrect functioning of the filter. To resolve this issue, check and delete all blank cells. In case your Excel file is too large to delete the blank cells, then you can add a “Serial number” row as an alternative. Adding serial number row creates a data continuity, thus helping in fixing the filter-related issue.

### **Method 4: Unhide Hidden Rows and Columns**

Hidden rows or columns in worksheets can also affect the filter functionality. You can check and unhide rows/columns to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the affected Excel file, go to Home.
- Click on **Format > Hide & Unhide**.

![Excel file: Navigating to Home, accessing Format > Hide & Unhide.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-format-select-hide-or-unhide-option-1024x228.jpg)

- Click **Unhide Rows** or **Unhide Columns** (as required).

### **Method 5: Unmerge Cells**

You can experience the filter in Excel is not working issue if you are using the filter to extract data from merged cells. Ensure to unmerge the “merged cells” before applying a filter in Excel. Follow the below steps to unmerge the merged cells in Excel:

- Navigate to the **Home** option.
- In the toolbar, select the **Merge & Center** option.
- Click **Unmerge Cells.**

### **Method 6: Repair the Workbook**

Sometimes, the **Filter Not Working in Excel** issue can occur due to inconsistencies in file structure. If these issues occurred due to corruption in the worksheet, you can repair it using the Open and Repair tool. It is an in-built tool in Excel that is used to repair corrupted Excel files.

## How to Fix Excel Formulas Not Working Properly | Step-by-Step Guide

**Summary:** Excel formulas sometimes fail to function correctly and even return an error. This article explains what you might be doing wrong that prevents Excel formulas from working properly and solutions to resolve the issue. If your formulas have disappeared from the Excel spreadsheet and you are having trouble recovering them, you can use an Excel repair tool to recover the formulas.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

When working with Excel formulas, situations may arise when the formula doesn’t calculate or update automatically. Or, you may receive errors by clicking on a formula.

## Problems Causing the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue and Solutions

Let’s check out the possible reasons that cause Excel formulas to work properly and solutions to resolve the issue.

### Problem 1 – Switching Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode

Automatic and manual are the two modes of calculation in Microsoft Excel.

By default, Excel is set to automatic calculation mode. Everything is recalculated automatically when any changes are made in a worksheet in this mode. You may switch from automatic to manual mode to disable the recalculation of formulas, particularly when working with a large Excel file with too many formulas.

Excel will not calculate automatically when set to manual calculation mode. And this may make you think that the Excel formula is not working properly.

### Solution – Change Calculation Mode from Manual to Automatic

To do so, perform these steps:

- Click on the column with problematic formulas.
- Go to the **Formulas** tab, click the **Calculation Options** drop-down, and select **Automatic**.

![Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/switch-manual-to-automatic-calculation-1.png)

### Problem 2 – Missing or Mismatched Parentheses

It’s easy to miss or incorrectly place parentheses or include extra parentheses in a complex formula. If a parenthesis is missing or mismatched and you click Enter after entering a formula, Excel displays a message window suggesting to fix the issue (refer to the screenshot below).

![Missing or Mismatched Parentheses](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/missing-or-mismatched-parantheses-2.png)

Clicking ‘Yes’ might help fix the issue. But Excel might not fix the parentheses properly, as it tends to add the missing parentheses at the end of a formula which won’t always be the case.

### Solution – Check for Visual Cues When Typing or Editing a Formula with Parentheses

When typing a formula or editing one, Excel provides visual cues to determine if there’s an issue with the parentheses inserted in a formula. Checking for these visual cues can help you fix missing/mismatched parentheses.

- Excel helps identify parenthesis pairs by highlighting them in different colors. For instance, the pair of parenthesis outside is black.
- Excel does not make the opening parentheses bold. So, if you’ve inserted the last closing parentheses in a formula, you can determine if your parentheses are mismatched.
- Excel helps identify parentheses pairs by highlighting and formatting them with the same color once you cross over them.

### Problem 3 – Formatting Cells in an Excel Formula

When adding a number in an Excel formula, don’t add any decimal separator or special characters like $ or €. You may use a comma to separate a function’s argument in an Excel formula or use a currency sign like $ or € as part of cell references. Formatting the numbers may prevent the formula from functioning correctly.

### Solution – Use Format Cells Option for Formatting

Use Format Cells instead of using a comma or currency signs for formatting a number in the formula. For instance, rather than entering a value of $10,000 in your formula, insert 10000, and click the ‘Ctrl+1’ keys together to open the Format Cells dialog box.

![Format Cells Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-3-1.png)

### Problem 4 – Formatting Numbers as Text

Numbers are displayed as left-aligned in a sheet in a worksheet, and text formatted numbers are right-aligned in cells. Excel considers numbers formatted as text to be text strings. Thus, it leaves those numbers out of calculations. As a result, a formula won’t work as intended. For example, in the following screenshot, you can see that the SUM formula works correctly for normal numbers. But, when the SUM formula is applied to numbers formatted as text, the formula doesn’t return the correct value.

![Cells Formatted as Text](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cells-formatted-as-text-4.png)

Sometimes, you may also see an apostrophe in the cells or green triangles in the top-left corner of all the cells when numbers in those cells are formatted as Text.

### Solution – Do Not Format Numbers as Text

To fix the issue, do the following:

- Select the cells with numbers stored as text, right-click on them, and click Format Cells.
- From the Format Cells window, click on Number and then press OK.

![Format Cells in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-5.png)

### Problem 5 – Double Quotes to Enclose Numbers

Avoid enclosing numbers in a formula in double-quotes, as the numbers are interpreted as a string value.

Meaning if you enter a formula like =IF(A1>B1, “1”), Excel will consider the output one as a string and not a number. So, you won’t be able to use 1’s in calculations.

### Solution – Don’t Enclose Numbers in Double Quotes

Remove any double quotes around a number in your formula unless you want that number to be treated as text. For example, you can write the formula mentioned above as “1” =IF(A1>B1, 1).

### Problem 6 – Extra Space at Beginning of the Formula

When entering a formula, you may end up adding an extra space before the equal (=) sign. You may also add an apostrophe (‘) in the formula at times. As a result, the calculation won’t be performed and may return an error. This usually happens when you use a formula copied from the web.

### Solution – Remove Extra Space from the Formula

The fix to this issue is pretty simple. You need to look for extra space before the equal sign and remove it. Also, ensure there is an additional apostrophe added in the formula.

## Other Things to Consider to Fix the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue

- If your Excel formula is not showing the result as intended, see this [blog](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
- When you refer to other worksheets with spaces or any non-alphabetical character in their names, enclose the names in ‘single quotation marks’. For example, an external 5reference to cell A2 in a sheet named Data enclose the name in single quotes: **‘Data’!A1**.
- You may see the formula instead of the result if you have accidentally clicked the ‘Show Formulas’ option. So, click on the problematic cell, click on the Formula tab, and then click Show Formulas.
- If you’re getting an error “Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet”, find solutions to fix the error [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

The error indicates that the values you are trying to paste do not match the cell format (Currency, Date, Text, etc.) used in the column. The error can occur if you are attempting to paste information into a merged cell. You can also get this error if the data you are trying to paste contains more columns than the destination worksheet can accept or if the copy area and paste area aren't the same size.

## Why you cannot Paste the Data in Microsoft Excel?

You can experience the "Excel cannot paste the data" error due to one of the following reasons:

- Locked cells
- Data size limitation
- Formatting issues
- The file size is too large
- Overloaded clipboard
- Data type mismatch
- Invalid range
- Lack of permissions
- Excel file is corrupted
- Compatibility issues
- While pasting the merged cells

## **Methods to Fix MS Excel Cannot Paste the Data Error**

The "Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data" error usually appears when copying and pasting data within the spreadsheet. It primarily affects the copy-and-paste feature within the Excel file. However, the impact of this error may vary with the data you are working with. When this error occurs, first try restarting the Excel application. Ensure that you've saved all your important data before restarting the application to prevent data loss. If, after performing this basic step, you still face the issue, then try the following troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check and Unlock Cells in Excel**

You can get the Excel cannot paste the data error if the cells you are trying to paste in the Excel file are locked. You can check and unlock the specific cells in the Excel file using the below steps:

- Go to the **Home** tab in your Excel file and click **Format Cell Font** popup launcher.

![Clicking Cell Font In Home](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-format-cell-font-on-home-tab.jpg)

- In the **Format Cells** dialog box, click **Protection**.

![Selecting Protection from Font family with formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-protection-in-format-cells.jpg)

- Under the **Protection** option, unselect the locked field and then click **OK**.

![Click on Locked Cell under Protection Tab](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-locked-under-protection.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Fix the Cell Format**

Sometimes, you can get the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel if there is an issue with the formatting of the cells in the column (in which you are trying to paste the data). You can check whether the cell formats of the columns of the source file (from where you are copying data) match the destination file (in which you are pasting the cell data). If not, then change the cell format. Here's how to do so:

- In the Excel file, click on the affected column heading (whose cells you need to modify).
- Navigate to the **Home** tab and click the **General** dropdown menu.

**![Navigate to Home and Click general drop down menu in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-general-dropdown-menu.jpg)**

- Click on the desired cell format that matches the values you are trying to paste into the column.

### **Method 3: Check Copy and Paste Area Size**

The "data cannot be pasted" issue can also occur if Excel detects the copy area of the range of cells is not of the same size and shape as that of the paste area. So, make sure the size of the range of cells for the paste area is same as the copied area. To ensure this, you can try the following:

- **Use Upper-left Cell**

 You can select the upper-left cell instead of the complete range to paste.

- **Use Paste Special Option**

- You can use the **Paste Special** option to paste the data. To use this option, go to **Home > Paste Special**.

![Navigate to Home And click on Paste Special in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-and-then-click-paste-special.png)

- You can choose from the different options, such as paste all, formulas, operations, Transpose, skip blanks, etc. to take control over how the data is pasted.

![Click on Paste and Selection of Operations from Paste Special Properties](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-operations-from-paste-special.jpg)

### **Method 4:** Check and Unmerge Cells

The merged cells in the workbook can create discrepancies when copying and pasting data. These can create mismatch between the source and destination cell areas, resulting in errors. Make sure you are not pasting the data copied from merged cells. You can check and unmerge the cells using the below steps:

- Open the Excel file (in which you are copying data) and go to the Home tab.
- Click Merge & Center > Unmerge Cells.

![Under Excel Navigate to Home and click on Merge and Center](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-click-on-merge-and-center.jpg)

### **Method 5: Unselect the Excel DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) Option**

Sometimes, you can get the Excel cannot paste the data error while copying and pasting data from Excel file to external data sources or applications. It usually appears if you have established DDE links between them. To resolve this, you can uncheck the "Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)" option. Follow the below steps to do so:

- Open your Excel file.
- Go to **File > Options**.

In **Excel Options**, click **Advanced** and unselect **"Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**. Click **OK.**

**![Under Excel Navigate to Home and click on Merge and Center](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-ignoring-dynamic-data-exchange-option.jpg)**

## Here are some additional solutions you can try to fix the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel

### **Check the Excel File Format**

Sometimes, the copy and paste error can occur if you try to move data from an older version of Excel file (XLS) into a newer version file (XLSX) or vice versa. You can try to change or convert the file format to resolve the issue.

### **Clear Clipboard**

Too many items on the clipboard can prevent you from copying and pasting the data. You can [empty your clipboard](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/clear-the-clipboard-7afbf55f-d7d5-4096-87a0-eb17f821d321) by deleting all clips. To do this, go to **Home** and click the **Clipboard** option.

### **Change the Column's Cell Format**

You can get the "Cannot paste the data" error when the information you need to paste does not match the cell format in the column. In such a case, you can change the column's cell format. To do this, navigate to the **Home** option and then click on the **General menu** arrow. Then, change the cell format suitable to the type of information you are trying to paste in that column.

### **Add Columns**

The copy-and-paste error in Excel can also occur if there are not enough columns to accept the data that you are trying to paste. You can insert more columns and then try copying and pasting data. To insert additional columns, click on the column heading, click **Home**, and then select **Insert.**

### **Remove Incompatible Add-ins**

Sometimes, incompatible or faulty add-ins can also create conflicts with Excel's clipboard operations, leading to the error. To check if add-ins are causing the issue, open the Excel file in safe mode. In safe mode, if you are able to paste the data, then check and uninstall the incompatible Excel Add-ins.

## **What to do if Nothing Works?**

If the above methods do not work, then corruption in the Excel file could be the cause of the "Cannot paste the data" error. In such a case, you can use Excel's built-in Open and Repair utility to repair the corrupted file. Here's how to use this utility to repair the Excel file:
