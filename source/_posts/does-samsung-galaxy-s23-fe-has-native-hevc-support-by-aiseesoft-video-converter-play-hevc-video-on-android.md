    My Samsung Galaxy S23 FE won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 FE which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my Samsung Galaxy S23 FE? I would really appreciate any help."

<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">

    This is probably because your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE doesn’t have enough power to handle 4K HEVC files. In this situation, we would recommend converting them to a format that is well supported by your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE first.
