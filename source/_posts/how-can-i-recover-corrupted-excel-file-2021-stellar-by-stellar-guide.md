![Excel-cannot-open-this-file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-cannot-open-this-file-img2.png)

## Why does Excel File turn Corrupt?

Following are some common reasons that can turn an Excel file corrupt:

- Large size of the Excel file
- The file is virus infected
- Hard drive on which Excel file is stored has developed bad sectors
- Abrupt system shutdown while working on a worksheet

## Workarounds to Recover Data from Corrupt Excel

The workarounds to recover corrupted Excel file 2016 data will vary depending on whether you can open the file or not.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Can Open the File?

If the corrupt Excel file is open, try any of the following workarounds to retrieve the data:

### **Workaround 1 – Use the Recover Unsaved Workbooks Option**

If your Excel file gets corrupt while you are working on it and you haven’t saved the changes, you can try retrieving the file’s data by following these steps:

- Open your Excel 2016 application and click on the **Open Other Workbooks** option.

![open-other-workbooks](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-other-workbooks-img3.png)

- Click the **Recover Unsaved Workbooks** button at the bottom of the ‘Recent Workbooks’ section.

![recover-unsaved-workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/recover-unsaved-workbook-img4.png)

- A window with list of unsaved Excel files will open. Click the corrupt file you want to open.

This will reopen your last saved version of the Excel workbook. If this method doesn’t work, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Revert to Last Saved Version of your Excel File**

If your Excel file gets corrupt in the middle of making any changes, you can recover the file’s data if the changes haven’t been saved. For this, you need to revert to the last saved version of your Excel file. Doing so will discard any changes that may have caused the file to turn corrupt. Here’s how to do it:

- In your Excel 2016 file, click **File** from the main menu.
- Click **Open**. From the list of workbooks under Recent workbooks, double-click the corrupt workbook that is already open in Excel.
- Click **Yes** when prompted to reopen the workbook.

Excel will revert the corrupt file to its last saved version. If it fails, skip to the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Save the Corrupted Excel File in Symbolic Link (SYLK) Format**

Saving an Excel file in SYLK format might help you filter out corrupted elements from the file. Here are the steps to do so:

- From your Excel **File** menu, choose **Save As**.
- In ‘Save As’ window that pops-up, from the **Save as type** dropdown list, choose the **SYLK (Symbolic Link)** option, and then click **Save**.

![symbolic link format](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/save-as-symbolic-link-format-img5.png)

**_Note:_** _Only the active sheet will be saved in workbook on choosing the SYLK format._

- Click **OK** when prompted that “The selected file type does not support workbooks that contain multiple sheets”. This will only save the active sheet.

![Workbooks contain multiple sheets warning msg](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Workbooks-contain-multiple-sheets-warning-msg-img6.png)

- Click **Yes** when the warning message appears - “Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as SYLK (Symbolic Link)”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-message-img7.png)  

- Click **File** > **Open**.
- **Browse** the corrupt workbook saved with SYLK format (.slk) and open it.
- After opening the file, select **File** > **Save As**.
- In ‘Save as type’ dialog box, select Excel workbook.
- Rename the workbook and hit the **Save** button.

After performing these steps, a copy of your original workbook will be saved at the specified location.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Cannot Open the File?

If you can’t access the Excel file, apply one of these workarounds to salvage the file’s data.

### **Workaround 1 – Open and Repair the Excel File**

Excel automatically initiates ‘File Recovery’ mode on opening a corrupt file. After starting the auto-recovery mode, it attempts to reopen and repair the corrupt Excel file at the same time. If the auto-recovery mode does not start automatically, you can try to fix corrupted Excel file 2016 manually by using ‘Open and Repair’. Follow these steps:

- Open a blank file, click the **File** tab and select **Open**.
- **Browse** the location where the corrupt 2016 Excel file is stored.
- When an ‘Open’ dialog box appears, select the file you want to repair.
- Once the file is selected, click the arrow next to the **Open** button, and then click the **Open and Repair** button.
- Do any of these actions:
- Click **Repair** to fix corrupted file and recover data from it.
- Click **Extract Data** if you cannot repair the file or only need to extract values and formulas.

![repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/repair-excel-file-img8.jpg)

If performing these actions doesn’t help you retrieve the data, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

Follow these steps to disable the protected view settings in an Excel file:

- Open a blank 2016 workbook.

![blank excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/blank-excel-file-img9.png)

- Click the **File** tab and then select **Options**.

![Excel file options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-file-options-img10.png)

- When an **Excel Options** window opens, click **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings.**

![open excel trust center settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-excel-trust-center-settings-img11.png)

- In the window that pops-up, choose **Protected View** from the left side navigation. Under ‘Protected View’, uncheck all the checkboxes, and then hit **OK**.

![disable-protected-view-settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-protected-view-settings.png)

Now, try opening your corrupt Excel 2016 file. If it won’t open, try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Link to the Corrupt Excel File using External References**

If you only need to extract Excel file data without formulas or calculated values, use external references to link to your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Here’s how you can do it:

- From your Excel file, click **File** > **Open**.
- From the window that opens, click **Computer** and then click **Browse** and copy the name of your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Click the **Cancel** button.

![browse corrupted excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/browse-corrupted-excel-file-img13.png)

- Go back to your Excel file, click **File** > **New** > **Blank workbook**.

![new excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/new-excel-workbook-img14.png)

- In the new Excel workbook, type “=CorruptExcelFile Name!A1” in cell A1 to reference cell A1 of the corrupted file. Replace the ‘CorruptExcelFile Name’ with the name of the corrupt file that you have copied above. Hit **ENTER**.
- If ‘Update Values’ dialog box appears, select the corrupt 2016 Excel file, and then click **OK**.
- If ‘Select Sheet’ dialog box pops-up, select a corrupt sheet, and press the **OK** button.
- Select and drag cell A1 till the columns required to store the data of your corrupted Excel file.
- Next, copy **row A** and drag it down to the rows needed to save the file’s data.
- Select and copy the file’s data.
- From the **Edit** menu, choose the **Paste Special** option and then select **Values**. Click **OK** to paste values and remove the reference links to the corrupt file.

Check the new Excel file for recoverable data. If this didn’t work, consider using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) to retrieve data.

## How Do I Restore Excel File ?

Excel (XLS/XLSX) file corruption is a common issue that may arise due to problems, such as abrupt system shutdown, system crash, malware or virus intrusion, unsupported add-in, etc. However, MS Excel comes with a recovery feature that allows users to recover or restore Excel files lost or corrupted when the MS Excel quits unexpectedly or computer crashes due to hardware or software-related issues.  

But sometimes, the restored version of the Excel file may not contain all the data or changes you made recently. In such cases, you are left with the option to repair the damaged or corrupt Excel file with the help of an Excel repair software, such as [Stellar Repair for Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## Solutions to Restore Excel File

Below we have discussed various solutions to repair, recover, and restore unsaved, lost, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel files with the help of MS Excel options and Excel repair software.

**_NOTE:_** _Some of these methods work only if you had enabled or configured certain required settings or options before corruption or losing the Excel file._

### 1\. Restore Lost or Unsaved Excel File via ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks’ Option

The _Recover Unsaved Workbooks_ option allows you to restore the Excel file that you forgot to save before closing MS Excel or it stopped working. The steps are as follows:

- Navigate to ‘_File > Open._’
- Scroll to the bottom and click on ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks.’ This opens a File Explorer browser window.

![recover unsaved excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/recover-unsaved-document.png)

- Now look for the Excel file that you lost and then double-click on it to open and restore the Excel file.
- Once the file is open, click on **File > Save As** and save it to your desired location.

However, this option works only if you had enabled and set up the ‘_Save AutoRecover information every X minutes_’ option and enabled the ‘_Keep the last AutoRecovered version if I close without saving’_ option.  

![change excel settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/change-settings-excel.png)

Also, this may not restore the most recent copy of your Excel file, but it will surely save your time that went into creating and editing the workbook.

### 2\. Repair and Restore Corrupt or Inaccessible Excel File

If the Excel file you are trying to open or access is corrupt, MS Excel will display an error message. When MS Excel detects corruption, it starts ‘File Recovery Mode’ to repair the Excel workbook.

However, if it doesn’t start automatically, you can manually repair minor corruption error and restore the Excel file by following these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Open** and then navigate to the corrupt or damaged Excel file location.
- Select the file and then click on the arrow beside the ‘**Open**’ button to choose the **‘Open and Repair…**’ option.

![open and repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/open-and-repair-excel-file.png)

- Now click ‘**Repair’** if you want to recover maximum data from a corrupt or inaccessible Excel workbook and restore it to a new Excel file.

![repair corrupt excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repair-corrupt-excel-sheet.png)

If the ‘**Repair’** option fails, use the Extract Data option that extracts values, data, and formulas from the Excel workbook.

### 3\. Revert Excel File to Last Saved Version

When an Excel file gets corrupt or damaged while working, you may revert the Excel file to the last saved version. This allows you to restore the Excel file version that isn’t corrupt or damaged. The steps are as follows,

- Click File > Open.
- Double-click the name of the workbook that you have opened in Excel.
- Click Yes to reopen the workbook.

The workbook opens without any changes you’ve made that might have caused the workbook to become corrupted.

### 4\. Use Excel Repair Software to Restore Excel File

If the corrupt or damaged Excel file isn’t repaired by using MS Excel options or you lost data after restoring the unsaved version or after reverting to the last version, you can rely on an Excel repair software, such as Stellar Repair for Excel.

The software repairs Excel files with 100% integrity and restores the Excel data, such as table, Pivot tables, charts, etc., while preserving the workbook properties and formatting.

If this is not the issue, then follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Review VBA Code

The exception from hresult 0x800a03ec excel can occur if you are trying to execute incorrect or incomplete queries in the Excel VBA code. It can also appear if the formulas do not contain the equal (=) symbol at the beginning. Verify the VBA code for any logical flaws, typo errors, syntax errors, or missing references.

### Method 2: Check the Field Size

Excel has certain [limits and specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). If the Excel file’s data exceeds these designated size limits, you can get the MS Excel error code 0x800A03EC error. For example, this error occurs if you try to export a file with more rows than the limit of 65536 and columns than the limit of 256. Check and optimize the file size by minimizing complex formulas and other objects.

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

Sometimes, disabled items in Add-ins settings can prevent macros from functioning correctly. You can check and enable the disabled items in Add-ins using these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Options**.

![Go To Options Tab](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-options-tab.jpg)
