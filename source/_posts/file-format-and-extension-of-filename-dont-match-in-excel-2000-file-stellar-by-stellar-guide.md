You can encounter the **“File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe”** error when the Excel application detects any issue with the file. This happens when you try to open an old version file format in a newer version or if the file is received from an unsafe destination. This can prevent you from opening the Excel file.

**As indicated from the error message, this error occurs due to the following reasons:**

- The file has incorrect file extension.
- The file is corrupted.
- The file you are trying to open is protected.

Now, let’s see how to resolve this Excel error.

## **Methods to Fix the “File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match” Error**

Try the following methods to troubleshoot the “File format and extension don’t match” error in Excel.

### **Method 1: Rename the Excel File**

You can face the “File format and extension don’t match” issue if the file has incorrect extension. It can occur if the file extension has been altered or you’ve mistakenly saved the file with incorrect extension. To fix this, you can try renaming the Excel file with the correct file extension.  

### **Method 2: Check the Default Excel File Format**

Different versions of Microsoft Excel use different default file formats. For example, .xls is the default file format of older versions (2003 and lower) of Excel, whereas .xlsx format is used by the newer versions (2007 and later). Opening the Excel file with an incompatible extension can cause the “File format and extension don’t match” issue. You can check the Excel version you are using and ensure it’s compatible with the Excel file you are trying to open.

### **Method 3: Change the Protected View Settings**

You may receive the “**File format and extension of excel don’t match**” error if the Excel file is protected. You can check and try disabling the [Protected View settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653).  

**Caution:** Changing the Protected View settings can put your system at risk. If the Excel file is being downloaded from the internet, it may contain viruses that can infect your system. So be careful before disabling the Protected View settings.

### **Steps to Change Protected View Settings in Excel:**

- In the Excel’s File menu, click on **Options.**
- Select **Trust Center > Trust Center Settings**.

- Under **Trust Center**, select **Protected View** and disable the below three options:

- Click **OK.** Then, try to open the Excel file.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide the Excel File Permissions**

- Locate the affected Excel file, right-click on it, and select **Properties.**

## Workarounds to Resolve the 'Excel found unreadable content in filename.xls' Error

There is no permanent solution to fix the 'Excel found unreadable content' error. But, following are some workarounds you can try to resolve the error.

**_Note:_** _Before you try any of these workarounds, run Excel with administrator privileges and try opening the Excel file that is throwing the 'unreadable content' error. If this doesn't fix the error, proceed with the workarounds below._

### **Workaround 1 – Try Opening the File in Excel 2003**

Sometimes a problem in the current Excel version might prevent a file from opening. To resolve this error, try opening the problematic file in Excel 2003. If the file opens, save the data in a web page file format (.html) and then try opening the .html file in MS Excel 2010/2007. The detailed step-wise instructions are as follows:

- Open the .xls file in Excel 2003.
- When the file opens, click on File > Save.
- In the 'Save As' dialog box, choose Web Page (.html) as the 'Save as type' and then click 'Save.' Doing so will save everything from your .xls file, opened with 2003, in .html file format.
- Open the .html file in Excel 2010/2007. And then, save the file with .xlsx extension with a new name to avoid overwriting the original file.

Now, open the Excel 2010/2007 file and check if the error is fixed. If not, use the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Make the Excel File 'Read-only'**

Try to open your '.xlsx' file by making it 'read-only'. Follow these steps:

- In Excel, click 'File' from the main menu.
- Select 'Save' for a new document or 'Save As' for a previously saved document in the screen that appears.

![Excel File Saving Options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-file-saving-options-image-3.png)

- From the 'Save As' dialog box, click Tools > General Options.

![Select Read Only Recommended Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Select-read-only-recommended-option-image-5.png)

Now open a new '.xlsx' file and copy everything from the corrupt Excel file to this new file. Finally, save this file and try to open it again.

### **Workaround 3 – Move Excel File to a New Folder**

Some users have reported that they could open their Excel file, following the 'Excel unreadable content' error, by simply moving the file to a different folder and saving it under a new name. You can also move the affected file to a new folder and try opening it. If this didn't help resolve the error, follow the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Install Visual Basic Component**

At times, it is seen that installing the 'Visual Basic' component of MS Office 2010 resolves the 'Excel found unreadable content 2010' error. To do so, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Control Panel > Programs and select Microsoft Office 2010.
- Click 'Change' and then select 'Add or Remove Programs'.
- Next, click the 'plus' sign provided next to Office Shared Features.
- Click 'Visual Basic for Applications'. After that, right-click and choose 'Run from My Computer' and hit the 'Continue' button.

Follow these solutions in the given order. In case a method doesn't work, move to the next one.

### Solution 1: Restart Excel in Safe Mode

By starting MS Excel in safe mode, you can run the program without loading the Excel add-ins and with limited features. But COM add-ins are excluded.

To launch Excel in safe mode, close MS Excel and follow these steps,

- Create a shortcut of MS Excel (.exe) on Desktop
- Press and hold the Ctrl key while launching the program
- Click 'Yes' when a prompt appears to confirm

Alternatively, press Windows+R, type excel /safe and press 'Enter'. Use this to open Excel in safe mode on Windows 10, 8.1, 8, or 7 system.

![type excel /safe](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel8.jpg)

### Solution 2: Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins

In case Excel doesn't crash in Safe Mode, it's possible that some faulty add-ins are the culprit behind frequent Excel crash and freeze. These Excel add-ins may interfere or conflict with the Excel program.

![Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel9.jpg)

Find and remove the faulty add-in. It can resolve the issue. To do so, follow these steps,

- Restart Excel in normal mode and go to File> Options> Add-ins
- Choose COM Add-ins from the drop-down and click Go

![COM Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel10.jpg)

- Uncheck all the checkboxes and click OK

![Uncheck all the check boxes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel11.jpg)

- Restart Excel and check if the issue is resolved
-  If Excel doesn't crash or freeze anymore, open COM Add-ins and enable one add-in at a time followed by Excel restart. Then observe Excel for freeze or crash problem

This will help you find out the faulty add-in, which is causing the problem. Remove the add-in which is causing the problem to resolve the issue. If that doesn't fix, move to the next solution.

### Solution 3: Check and Install the Latest Updates

If you haven't set Windows to Download and Install Updates automatically, do it now.

Apart from updating the operating system, latest Windows updates sometimes fixes bugs for other applications installed on the system such as MS Office. Often installing an important update that you might have missed may correct the Excel crash problem.

You can also update MS Office manually. Follow these steps,

Go to File > Account

 Under Product Information, select Update Options and click Update Now

![Product Information](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel12.jpg)

If you have installed MS Excel from Microsoft Store, open the store and update your Office applications.

NOTE: This also works if you can't open Excel file or Excel crashes after Windows upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10.

After installing the latest MS Office updates, check if Excel works fine. If not, head to the next solution.

### Solution 4: Clear Conditional Formatting Rules

If a sheet is causing Excel to freeze or crash, there might be a problem with that particular sheet. In such a case, you may try clearing the Conditional Formatting rules. The steps are as follows,

- Under Home, click 'Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules\> Clear Rules from Entire Sheet'

![Conditional Formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel13.jpg)

- You may repeat this step for all other sheets in the Excel workbook
- Then click File> Save as and save the Sheet as a new file at a different location

This avoids overwriting or making changes to the original Excel file. Once done, try working on the sheet.

If this doesn't work out, move to the next solution.

### Solution 5: Remove Multiple Cell Formatting and Styles

If a workbook is being shared and edited by others on different platforms then it's possible that many cells are formatted differently. This can cause issues with Excel such as crash and freeze. It can also lead to Excel file corruption. The problem mostly occurs when a workbook contains multiple worksheets using different formatting.

You can [follow this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/troubleshoot/excel/too-many-different-cell-formats-in-excel) to remove different cell formats and styles, and then open the Excel file.

### Solution 6: Disable Microsoft Excel Animation

Animations require additional processing power and resources. By disabling animations in Excel, you may resolve Excel freeze and crash issue. This also improves MS Excel performance.

To disable the animations in MS Excel, follow these steps:

- Go to File > Options
- Click 'Advanced' and check 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'animation

![Disable hardware graphics acceleration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel14.jpg)

- Click 'OK' to close the window and then restart MS Excel

This has helped many users in fixing the Excel crash issue. If it doesn't work for you, head to the next solution.

### Solution 7: Check If Excel File is Generated by a Third-Party Application

There are applications which you may have used to generate Excel files to fetch data. For instance, downloading data from Google Analytics in Excel format.

Sometimes, these Excel files are not generated correctly by such third-party apps. Thus, some features in Excel may not work as intended when you access the files in MS Excel.

In such a case, you should get in touch with the app developer for help with the file or use Stellar Repair for Excel to repair such Excel files.

### Solution 8: Check If Antivirus or Other Apps are Conflicting with MS Excel

Ensure your antivirus is up-to-date and not conflicting with MS Excel. An outdated antivirus tool may conflict with Excel which can cause the application to hang, freeze, or crash.

- Update your antivirus
- Try disabling the add-in or integration between Excel and antivirus. See if it works

Alternatively, you may disable the anti-virus tool temporarily to check if it is the culprit behind Excel performance issue and crash. If that resolves the problem, get in touch with your antivirus vendor and report the problem.

They might provide you with a better solution or workaround to fix this problem without disabling the antivirus protection.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Disabling or altering antivirus protection makes your PC vulnerable to malicious attacks and virus or malware intrusion.

### Solution 9: Clean Boot Windows to Inspect the Cause Behind Excel Crash

When Windows boot, it starts several processes, services, and application during start up automatically, which runs in the background.

These startup apps and services can interfere with other applications such as MS Excel. To find out if that's the cause behind Excel crash, you can perform a Clean Boot.

This helps you identify processes, services, or applications that are conflicting with Excel. Steps to perform Clean Boot are as follows,

- Press Windows key + R, type MSConfig, and press 'Enter'
- In System Configuration window, click on the General tab and choose Selective startup

![System Configuration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel15.jpg)

Uncheck 'Load startup items' and click 'OK'

After this, close all running applications and restart your PC

Check if the crash problem with Excel is resolved. Uninstall the conflicting apps or update them. If your issue is not resolved, follow the next solution.

### Solution 10: Repair or Reinstall MS Office

Repairing Office programs may also resolve Excel crash issues if caused by damaged MS Excel program or MS Office files. The steps are as follow,

- Close all MS Office apps and open the Control Panel
- Click Uninstall a program under Programs

![Uninstall a program](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel16.jpg)

- Click on Microsoft Office and then click on the Change option
- Choose 'Quick repair' and then select 'Repair'

## How to Fix Excel File Couldn't Open in Protected View

**Summary:** This blog discusses about the Excel error 'The file couldn't open in Protected View' and workarounds to fix the error. If you cannot access the Excel file data, using an Excel file repair tool can help you quickly restore the data to its original state.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Protected View is a feature in Microsoft Excel that opens a file in read-only mode while disabling the editing functions. An Excel file opens in Protected View if the file is from an unsafe location. For example, the file may be opened from an insecure Internet location or downloaded as an Outlook attachment from suspicious senders. In that case, your Excel application won’t let you open the file to protect it against malware or virus attacks.

However, the Protected View feature sometimes prevents an Excel file from opening even if it is from a safe location. Also, opening an Excel file may return an error message ‘file couldn’t open in protected view’.

![the file couldn't open in Protected View excel error](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/file-couldnt-open-in-protected-view-error-1.png)

You may be able to resolve the issue by closing all the open Excel files, closing the Excel application, and then re-opening the problematic file. But this process can take a significant amount of time as you need to close and re-open the Excel application and the file continuously.

## **How to Fix the Excel File Couldn’t Open in Protected View Error?**

Here are some workarounds to fix the error:

### **Workaround 1 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

**Note:** Before disabling the protected view settings, ensure you have a reliable antivirus software installed on your computer to safeguard files against malware or virus attacks.

- Open the Excel file throwing the error, go to **File** and click the **Options** tab.
- From the Options dialog box, go to **Trust Center** and click on **Trust Center Settings**.
- From the Trust Center Settings dialog box, select the **Protected View** tab.
- Uncheck the appropriate option under the Protected View section, and then click **OK** to apply the changes. For instance, uncheck the “Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments” option if the file is a downloaded Outlook attachment.

![disable protected view settings ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/disable-protected-view-2.png)

- Click **OK** again.

Now try opening the problematic Excel file. If it still doesn’t open, try the following workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Repair the Office Installation**

Sometimes, corruption in the Office installation may cause Excel to return the ‘file could not open in protected view’ error. So, try repairing your Office installation and check if it solves the problem.

- Open the Control Panel and click the **Uninstall a program** option under **Programs**.
- Click **Uninstall a program** under the **Programs** tab.
- Right-click the Microsoft Office program you have installed and click the **Change** button.
- Select the **Repair** option and click **Continue**.

![repair office program](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/online-repair-microsoft-office-app-3-1024x387.png)

Once the repair operation is complete, check if you can open the Excel file without any issue.

### **Workaround 3 – Install Latest MS Office Updates**

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing [issues](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54) (such as the Protected View issue) on opening an Office document like Excel, Word, or others – after upgrading Windows to a newer version. This problem may occur due to incompatibility between the Office app and the updated Windows version. You can try to fix the problem by upgrading the Office app, and here’s how:

- Click on the **File** tab in the Excel file that throws an error.
- Click the **Account** tab at the left-hand bottom of the screen.
- From Office Updates, expand **Update Options**, and then click **Update Now**.

![office updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/update-excel-4.png)

After installing the updates, restart your PC and open the Excel file. If this doesn’t work, use the following workaround.

## **Workaround 4 – Convert the File and Rename It**

Some Excel users resolved the ‘Protected view’ issue by renaming their Excel files. But before that, ensure that the file you are trying to open is saved with .xlsx format. If the file type is .xls, you need to convert it to .xlsx format and then rename it. Before converting the file, save a copy of the original file in the desired location.

If the file type is .xlsx, copy the problematic file. Next, open a blank Excel document and paste the copied file. The file will appear as an icon, double-click on it. If it opens without any error, save it with a different name. Hopefully, reaming the Excel file may help resolve the problem.

## **Conclusion**

There is no fixed solution to resolve the Excel error ‘The file could not open in Protected View’. However, the workarounds discussed in the blog have helped users resolve the ‘Protected View’ issue. Make sure to use the workarounds in the same order as explained in the blog.

If you’re having an issue loading the Excel file data due to the ‘Protected View’ error, consider restoring the data using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
