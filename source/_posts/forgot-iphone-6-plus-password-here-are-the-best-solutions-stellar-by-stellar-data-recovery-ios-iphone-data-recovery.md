## Forgot iPhone passcode? What to do next?

Alright, I know it’s next to impossible that you will ever forget your passcode but we cannot overlook the fact that, yes there is a chance that you may forget it.

That said, let’s delve into some of the best solutions for forgotten iPhone password.  
If you’ve forgotten the password, these options will help you out:

- Erase your iOS device with iTunes to remove the password
- Erase the passcode with iCloud
- Use Recovery mode if you’re unable to connect to either iCloud or iTunes
- Leverage an iPhone data recovery to recover deleted/lost data
