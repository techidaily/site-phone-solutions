## Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Tecno Pop 8?

Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.

![pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg)

Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of "catching them all."

'Spoofing' location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you're in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.

## **Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?**

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo's Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.

So, ****is PGSharp legal?**** No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.

 According to Niantic's terms and conditions:

- "Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device's location (for example through GPS spoofing).
- And _"_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software)."

 If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.

- The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.
- The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.
- The third strike will permanently ban your account.

 You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you've been banned without violation of any terms.

## ****Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android****

1. **PGSharp :**

![pgsharp-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg)

PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.

****Note:**** It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.

- To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google's "Play store," search "PGSharp," and install it.
- After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.
- For the paid key, visit PGSharp's official website and generate a license key.

You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an "out of stock." message.

- After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.

****Note:**** You may need to allow "Mock location" from debugging options. For this, go to "Settings," then to "About Phone," then you need to tap on "Build number" seven times to enable developer's mode, and finally go to "Debugging" to allow "Mock location."

2. ****Fake GPS Go:****

![fake gps go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg)

Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world. This is one of the easiest solutions to playing Pokémon   Go while spoofing location without getting detected with its real-map-like UI. Moreover, this app does not even require root access.

- To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google's "Play store," search "Fake GPS Go," and install it.
- Then, go to your phone's "Settings" and then "System" followed by "About Phone," and tap on the "Build Number" 7 times to enable the Developer Options.
- Then you need to go to "Debugging" in "Developers Options" to allow "Mock location."
- And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.

3. **VPN:**

![vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.

Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.

- To install a VPN, go to Google's "Play store," search the VPN of your choice and install it.
- Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.
- Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.

****Note:**** Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data. Hence, selecting a good VPN app is imperative, which will spoof GPS location and data encryption.

You can use both VPNs (which do not spoof GPS location themselves) and the Fake location app simultaneously for extra reliability.

## ****Part 3: Best way to spoof on iOS – dr.fone Virtual Location****

Spoofing the GPS location on iPhones is more difficult and much more complex than it is on Android. However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.

Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select "Virtual Location" given on the first page of the program.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select "Get Started". Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3: Enable the "teleport mode" by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone's GPS to in the text box in the map's left-upper section. Select "Go".

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4: Now select "Move here." And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

****Pro-Tips:****

- Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.
- Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.
- Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)
- After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.
- Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.
- Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.

Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who's on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.

_**Tips:** Is 3uTools Virtual Location not working? Don't worry, we've got the solution! Dr.Fone - Virtual Location offers a seamless and reliable virtual location experience. Say goodbye to issues and hello to hassle-free location changes. Fix it right now with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!_



## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

![restart computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg)

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

![load embedded maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-6.jpg)

Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

### 8\. Uninstalling iTunes and rebooting your system

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.

Remove iTunes from your computer. Then, try restarting it. Install iTunes from the App Store once more. Restart your computer. After that, connect your iPhone to a PC and confirm that it is unlocked.

## 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Tecno Pop 8

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

![Route Generator App Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.
