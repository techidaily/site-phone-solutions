    Why convert HEVC/H.265 video for HTC U23 Pro?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your HTC U23 Pro struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your HTC U23 Pro first. That’s where an HEVC to HTC U23 Pro converter comes in.
