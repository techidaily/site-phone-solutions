## The Easiest Methods to Hard Reset Huawei P60

You can use **Huawei P60 A37 hard reset** to solve your various smartphone problems. If your Huawei P60 runs slower and its screen gets stuck, a hard reset can clear these problems. A hard reset also helps when you want to erase all data from your device before you sell. Suppose your phone runs out of storage. You can save your data on cloud storage and do a factory reset to free up space. You can also use it to unlock your device by removing the screen lock.

When you do a factory reset from settings, you will need the Huawei P60 device's password. Dr.Fone is the best tool to hard reset your Huawei P60 without a password. It has an easy-to-use UI, and safe data backup features to enable users to back up their data before resetting. Here is the complete guide to hard reset your Huawei P60 using three methods.

## Part 1: In What Cases Should I Hard Reset My Huawei P60?

### 1: Can't Unlock it (forgot password, too many wrong attempts)

Most people **hard reset Huawei P60** because they forgot the lock screen password. When you can't remember your phone's password, a hard reset is the fastest way to unlock your device. With a hard reset, you can delete all types of data and settings from your device. It helps you remove passwords, PINs, patterns, and fingerprint locks. Once you forget your phone's password and enter the wrong password too many times, you will get a blocking alert. After another wrong attempt, the system will block your device. When you reach this point, you can only use a hard reset to unlock your device.

### 2: Huawei P60 Works too Slowly

If your Huawei P60 works slowly, such as taking time when you open any app, you can use a hard reset to fix this problem.

### 3: Constant Crashes

Suppose your phone constantly crashes for no reason at all. Chances are that there is some problem with its software or new updates. When your device crashes, the screen gets stuck for some seconds before it automatically recovers. If it happens once in a while, then it is not a big problem. But, if it happens constantly, then you will need to fix your device before it gets even worse. An **Huawei P60 hard reset** reverts it to its factory settings by deleting all data, personalization, settings, and updates. Doing so removes any type of threat and bug from your device.
