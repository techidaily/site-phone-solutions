## How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Vivo S17t?

People are very happy about Snapchat’s new Snap map feature. It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.

![snap map feature](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg)

This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.

This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!

## **Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?**

The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?

Yes, Absolutely!

There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.

**Ghost Mode:** The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -

**Step 1:** If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.

![track camera screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg)

**Step 2:** On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.

![find bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg)

**Step 3:** The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.

![location setting on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg)

**Step 4:** The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.

![duration ghost mode](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg)

If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.

**Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone**

If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.

**Android**

The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.

**Step 1**: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.

![check location notification tray](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2**: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on/off.

![tap location on/off](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg)

**iPhone**

To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,

**Step 1:** Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.

![go to setting on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg)

**Step 2:** Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.

![tap privacy option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg)

**Step 3:** In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.

![click location services option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg)

**Step 4:** Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.

![turn off location service](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg)

These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.

## **Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat**

If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.

[Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Step 1**: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.

![dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Now connect Your Vivo S17t to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3**: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4**: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.

![set the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.

**VPN Service - NordVPN**

The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.

![nordvpn google play store](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.

![signup for quick connect](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.

![choose the server](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg)

So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.

## **Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?**

A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.

**Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?**

A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.

**Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?**

A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.

## **Part 4: Conclusion**

Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.

## Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Vivo S17t?

Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.

![pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg)

Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of "catching them all."

'Spoofing' location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you're in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.

## **Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?**

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo's Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.

So, ****is PGSharp legal?**** No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.

 According to Niantic's terms and conditions:

- "Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device's location (for example through GPS spoofing).
- And _"_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software)."

 If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.

- The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.
- The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.
- The third strike will permanently ban your account.

 You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you've been banned without violation of any terms.

## ****Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android****

1. **PGSharp :**

![pgsharp-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg)

PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.

****Note:**** It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.

- To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google's "Play store," search "PGSharp," and install it.
- After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.
- For the paid key, visit PGSharp's official website and generate a license key.

You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an "out of stock." message.

- After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.

****Note:**** You may need to allow "Mock location" from debugging options. For this, go to "Settings," then to "About Phone," then you need to tap on "Build number" seven times to enable developer's mode, and finally go to "Debugging" to allow "Mock location."

2. ****Fake GPS Go:****

![fake gps go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg)

Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world. This is one of the easiest solutions to playing Pokémon   Go while spoofing location without getting detected with its real-map-like UI. Moreover, this app does not even require root access.

- To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google's "Play store," search "Fake GPS Go," and install it.
- Then, go to your phone's "Settings" and then "System" followed by "About Phone," and tap on the "Build Number" 7 times to enable the Developer Options.
- Then you need to go to "Debugging" in "Developers Options" to allow "Mock location."
- And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.

3. **VPN:**

![vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.

Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.

- To install a VPN, go to Google's "Play store," search the VPN of your choice and install it.
- Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.
- Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.

****Note:**** Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data. Hence, selecting a good VPN app is imperative, which will spoof GPS location and data encryption.

You can use both VPNs (which do not spoof GPS location themselves) and the Fake location app simultaneously for extra reliability.

## ****Part 3: Best way to spoof on iOS – dr.fone Virtual Location****

Spoofing the GPS location on iPhones is more difficult and much more complex than it is on Android. However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.

Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select "Virtual Location" given on the first page of the program.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select "Get Started". Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3: Enable the "teleport mode" by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone's GPS to in the text box in the map's left-upper section. Select "Go".

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4: Now select "Move here." And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

****Pro-Tips:****

- Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.
- Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.
- Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)
- After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.
- Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.
- Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.

Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who's on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.
