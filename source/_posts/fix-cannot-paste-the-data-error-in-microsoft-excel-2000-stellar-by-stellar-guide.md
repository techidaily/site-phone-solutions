## Fix Cannot Paste the Data Error in Microsoft Excel

When copying and pasting the cell contents or attributes from one workbook to another, you can encounter the "Cannot paste the data" error. The error indicates that the values you are trying to paste do not match the cell format (Currency, Date, Text, etc.) used in the column. The error can occur if you are attempting to paste information into a merged cell. You can also get this error if the data you are trying to paste contains more columns than the destination worksheet can accept or if the copy area and paste area aren't the same size.

## Why you cannot Paste the Data in Microsoft Excel?

You can experience the "Excel cannot paste the data" error due to one of the following reasons:

- Locked cells
- Data size limitation
- Formatting issues
- The file size is too large
- Overloaded clipboard
- Data type mismatch
- Invalid range
- Lack of permissions
- Excel file is corrupted
- Compatibility issues
- While pasting the merged cells

## **Methods to Fix MS Excel Cannot Paste the Data Error**

The "Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data" error usually appears when copying and pasting data within the spreadsheet. It primarily affects the copy-and-paste feature within the Excel file. However, the impact of this error may vary with the data you are working with. When this error occurs, first try restarting the Excel application. Ensure that you've saved all your important data before restarting the application to prevent data loss. If, after performing this basic step, you still face the issue, then try the following troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check and Unlock Cells in Excel**

You can get the Excel cannot paste the data error if the cells you are trying to paste in the Excel file are locked. You can check and unlock the specific cells in the Excel file using the below steps:

- Go to the **Home** tab in your Excel file and click **Format Cell Font** popup launcher.

![Clicking Cell Font In Home](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-format-cell-font-on-home-tab.jpg)

- In the **Format Cells** dialog box, click **Protection**.

![Selecting Protection from Font family with formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-protection-in-format-cells.jpg)

- Under the **Protection** option, unselect the locked field and then click **OK**.

![Click on Locked Cell under Protection Tab](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-locked-under-protection.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Fix the Cell Format**

Sometimes, you can get the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel if there is an issue with the formatting of the cells in the column (in which you are trying to paste the data). You can check whether the cell formats of the columns of the source file (from where you are copying data) match the destination file (in which you are pasting the cell data). If not, then change the cell format. Here's how to do so:

- In the Excel file, click on the affected column heading (whose cells you need to modify).
- Navigate to the **Home** tab and click the **General** dropdown menu.

**![Navigate to Home and Click general drop down menu in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-general-dropdown-menu.jpg)**

- Click on the desired cell format that matches the values you are trying to paste into the column.

### **Method 3: Check Copy and Paste Area Size**

The "data cannot be pasted" issue can also occur if Excel detects the copy area of the range of cells is not of the same size and shape as that of the paste area. So, make sure the size of the range of cells for the paste area is same as the copied area. To ensure this, you can try the following:

- **Use Upper-left Cell**

 You can select the upper-left cell instead of the complete range to paste.

- **Use Paste Special Option**

- You can use the **Paste Special** option to paste the data. To use this option, go to **Home > Paste Special**.

![Navigate to Home And click on Paste Special in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-and-then-click-paste-special.png)

- You can choose from the different options, such as paste all, formulas, operations, Transpose, skip blanks, etc. to take control over how the data is pasted.

![Click on Paste and Selection of Operations from Paste Special Properties](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/select-operations-from-paste-special.jpg)

### **Method 4:** Check and Unmerge Cells

The merged cells in the workbook can create discrepancies when copying and pasting data. These can create mismatch between the source and destination cell areas, resulting in errors. Make sure you are not pasting the data copied from merged cells. You can check and unmerge the cells using the below steps:

- Open the Excel file (in which you are copying data) and go to the Home tab.
- Click Merge & Center > Unmerge Cells.

![Under Excel Navigate to Home and click on Merge and Center](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog/article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/go-to-home-click-on-merge-and-center.jpg)

### **Method 5: Unselect the Excel DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) Option**

Sometimes, you can get the Excel cannot paste the data error while copying and pasting data from Excel file to external data sources or applications. It usually appears if you have established DDE links between them. To resolve this, you can uncheck the "Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)" option. Follow the below steps to do so:

- Open your Excel file.
- Go to **File > Options**.

In **Excel Options**, click **Advanced** and unselect **"Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**. Click **OK.**

**![Under Excel Navigate to Home and click on Merge and Center](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-ignoring-dynamic-data-exchange-option.jpg)**

## Here are some additional solutions you can try to fix the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel

### **Check the Excel File Format**

Sometimes, the copy and paste error can occur if you try to move data from an older version of Excel file (XLS) into a newer version file (XLSX) or vice versa. You can try to change or convert the file format to resolve the issue.

### **Clear Clipboard**

Too many items on the clipboard can prevent you from copying and pasting the data. You can [empty your clipboard](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/clear-the-clipboard-7afbf55f-d7d5-4096-87a0-eb17f821d321) by deleting all clips. To do this, go to **Home** and click the **Clipboard** option.

### **Change the Column's Cell Format**

You can get the "Cannot paste the data" error when the information you need to paste does not match the cell format in the column. In such a case, you can change the column's cell format. To do this, navigate to the **Home** option and then click on the **General menu** arrow. Then, change the cell format suitable to the type of information you are trying to paste in that column.

### **Add Columns**

The copy-and-paste error in Excel can also occur if there are not enough columns to accept the data that you are trying to paste. You can insert more columns and then try copying and pasting data. To insert additional columns, click on the column heading, click **Home**, and then select **Insert.**

### **Remove Incompatible Add-ins**

Sometimes, incompatible or faulty add-ins can also create conflicts with Excel's clipboard operations, leading to the error. To check if add-ins are causing the issue, open the Excel file in safe mode. In safe mode, if you are able to paste the data, then check and uninstall the incompatible Excel Add-ins.

## **What to do if Nothing Works?**

If the above methods do not work, then corruption in the Excel file could be the cause of the "Cannot paste the data" error. In such a case, you can use Excel's built-in Open and Repair utility to repair the corrupted file. Here's how to use this utility to repair the Excel file:

- Open your Excel application.
- Navigate to **File** and then click **Open.**
- Click the **Browse** option to select the affected Excel file.
- The **Open** dialog box opens up. Click on the corrupted file.
- From the **Open** dropdown, select the **Open and Repair** option.
- The Excel will prompt you to choose one of the below options:
- Repair
- Extract
- Cancel
- Select the **Repair** option to extract maximum data from the file. If the Repair option fails, choose the **Extract** option to recover the data, excluding formulas and values.

 The [Open and Repair utility may not be able to repair your Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) if it is severely corrupted.

## Workarounds to Recover Data from Corrupt Excel

The workarounds to recover corrupted Excel file 2016 data will vary depending on whether you can open the file or not.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Can Open the File?

If the corrupt Excel file is open, try any of the following workarounds to retrieve the data:

### **Workaround 1 – Use the Recover Unsaved Workbooks Option**

If your Excel file gets corrupt while you are working on it and you haven’t saved the changes, you can try retrieving the file’s data by following these steps:

- Open your Excel 2016 application and click on the **Open Other Workbooks** option.

![open-other-workbooks](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-other-workbooks-img3.png)

- Click the **Recover Unsaved Workbooks** button at the bottom of the ‘Recent Workbooks’ section.

![recover-unsaved-workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/recover-unsaved-workbook-img4.png)

- A window with list of unsaved Excel files will open. Click the corrupt file you want to open.

This will reopen your last saved version of the Excel workbook. If this method doesn’t work, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Revert to Last Saved Version of your Excel File**

If your Excel file gets corrupt in the middle of making any changes, you can recover the file’s data if the changes haven’t been saved. For this, you need to revert to the last saved version of your Excel file. Doing so will discard any changes that may have caused the file to turn corrupt. Here’s how to do it:

- In your Excel 2016 file, click **File** from the main menu.
- Click **Open**. From the list of workbooks under Recent workbooks, double-click the corrupt workbook that is already open in Excel.
- Click **Yes** when prompted to reopen the workbook.

Excel will revert the corrupt file to its last saved version. If it fails, skip to the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Save the Corrupted Excel File in Symbolic Link (SYLK) Format**

Saving an Excel file in SYLK format might help you filter out corrupted elements from the file. Here are the steps to do so:

- From your Excel **File** menu, choose **Save As**.
- In ‘Save As’ window that pops-up, from the **Save as type** dropdown list, choose the **SYLK (Symbolic Link)** option, and then click **Save**.

![symbolic link format](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/save-as-symbolic-link-format-img5.png)

**_Note:_** _Only the active sheet will be saved in workbook on choosing the SYLK format._

- Click **OK** when prompted that “The selected file type does not support workbooks that contain multiple sheets”. This will only save the active sheet.

![Workbooks contain multiple sheets warning msg](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Workbooks-contain-multiple-sheets-warning-msg-img6.png)

- Click **Yes** when the warning message appears - “Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as SYLK (Symbolic Link)”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-message-img7.png)  

- Click **File** > **Open**.
- **Browse** the corrupt workbook saved with SYLK format (.slk) and open it.
- After opening the file, select **File** > **Save As**.
- In ‘Save as type’ dialog box, select Excel workbook.
- Rename the workbook and hit the **Save** button.

After performing these steps, a copy of your original workbook will be saved at the specified location.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Cannot Open the File?

If you can’t access the Excel file, apply one of these workarounds to salvage the file’s data.

### **Workaround 1 – Open and Repair the Excel File**

Excel automatically initiates ‘File Recovery’ mode on opening a corrupt file. After starting the auto-recovery mode, it attempts to reopen and repair the corrupt Excel file at the same time. If the auto-recovery mode does not start automatically, you can try to fix corrupted Excel file 2016 manually by using ‘Open and Repair’. Follow these steps:

- Open a blank file, click the **File** tab and select **Open**.
- **Browse** the location where the corrupt 2016 Excel file is stored.
- When an ‘Open’ dialog box appears, select the file you want to repair.
- Once the file is selected, click the arrow next to the **Open** button, and then click the **Open and Repair** button.
- Do any of these actions:
- Click **Repair** to fix corrupted file and recover data from it.
- Click **Extract Data** if you cannot repair the file or only need to extract values and formulas.

![repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/repair-excel-file-img8.jpg)

If performing these actions doesn’t help you retrieve the data, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

Follow these steps to disable the protected view settings in an Excel file:

- Open a blank 2016 workbook.

![blank excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/blank-excel-file-img9.png)

- Click the **File** tab and then select **Options**.

![Excel file options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-file-options-img10.png)

- When an **Excel Options** window opens, click **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings.**

![open excel trust center settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-excel-trust-center-settings-img11.png)

- In the window that pops-up, choose **Protected View** from the left side navigation. Under ‘Protected View’, uncheck all the checkboxes, and then hit **OK**.

![disable-protected-view-settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-protected-view-settings.png)

Now, try opening your corrupt Excel 2016 file. If it won’t open, try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Link to the Corrupt Excel File using External References**

If you only need to extract Excel file data without formulas or calculated values, use external references to link to your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Here’s how you can do it:

- From your Excel file, click **File** > **Open**.
- From the window that opens, click **Computer** and then click **Browse** and copy the name of your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Click the **Cancel** button.

![browse corrupted excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/browse-corrupted-excel-file-img13.png)

- Go back to your Excel file, click **File** > **New** > **Blank workbook**.

![new excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/new-excel-workbook-img14.png)

- In the new Excel workbook, type “=CorruptExcelFile Name!A1” in cell A1 to reference cell A1 of the corrupted file. Replace the ‘CorruptExcelFile Name’ with the name of the corrupt file that you have copied above. Hit **ENTER**.
- If ‘Update Values’ dialog box appears, select the corrupt 2016 Excel file, and then click **OK**.
- If ‘Select Sheet’ dialog box pops-up, select a corrupt sheet, and press the **OK** button.
- Select and drag cell A1 till the columns required to store the data of your corrupted Excel file.
- Next, copy **row A** and drag it down to the rows needed to save the file’s data.
- Select and copy the file’s data.
- From the **Edit** menu, choose the **Paste Special** option and then select **Values**. Click **OK** to paste values and remove the reference links to the corrupt file.

Check the new Excel file for recoverable data. If this didn’t work, consider using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) to retrieve data.

## **How to Open a Corrupt Excel File without Backup?**

Following are some manual methods that can help you open a corrupt Excel file:

### **Method 1: Repair Corrupt Excel File**

When attempting to open a corrupt file, Excel automatically starts ‘File Recovery’ mode to repair the file. But, if the recovery mode doesn’t start, try Microsoft Excel’s built-in ‘Open and Repair’ feature to manually repair the file.

To use this feature, perform the following steps:

**Step 1:** Open a **Blank workbook** in Excel, and then click **File > Open**.

**Step 2:** In the **Open** window, browse and select the corrupt file.

**Step 3:** Click the arrow that is beside the **Open** tab, and select **Open and Repair**.

Open and Repair Option

**Step 4:** Implement one of the following:

- Click the **Repair** button. (This is to recover as much data as possible.)
- Click the **Extract Data** button. (This is to recover values and formulas from the Excel file if the repair process fails to recover the entire data.)

Excel Built-in Repair Options

If using [Open and Repair does not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), move to the next method.

### **Method 2: Disable the Protected View Feature**

Some Excel users have reported that turning off the ‘protected view’ feature in Excel helped them open the corrupt file. You can also try to disable this feature and open the file. To do so, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Open a blank Excel file, click on **File** > **Options**.

**Step 2:** In the **Excel Options** window, select **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.

![In the Trust Center tab, click on Trust Center Settings...](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Excel-trust-center-settings.png)

Excel Trust Center Settings

**Step 3:** Click **OK.**

Now check if you can open the corrupt file. If not, try implementing the next method.

### **Method 3: Look For Automatically Recovered Excel File**

**The ‘AutoRecover’** feature saves Excel worksheets at a temporary location after a certain time interval. It saves the worksheets automatically and is turned on by default to reduce the chance of data loss.

## How to Repair Excel Document on a Flash Drive

**Summary:** Microsoft Excel files are stored on flash drives if they need to be transferred between systems or if they need to be backed up. But sometimes unforeseen issues can corrupt the Excel sheets stored on flash drives. When that happens, it can be an arduous task to repair Excel documents on a flash drive. Through this post let us try to understand the reasons why Excel sheets stored on flash drives can get corrupted and how users can resolve them easily.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

In this digital age, we all work with computers, files, and documents. Flash drives or USBs are common ways of storing data in an external place. Be it for a meeting or for a party playlist, these devices come handy when one wants to transfer data or access the files stored elsewhere.

You may need to access your data from another location. That’s when a USB flash drive might come in handy. And, that’s exactly why Excel sheets too end up on flash drives; either that or for backup purposes. However, there are many instances where an Excel file stored in a USB gets corrupted when one tries to access the file. The error message you get while trying to open the Excel file would be a great clue for figuring out the exact reason behind corruption.

This blog will provide insights into what are the reasons for the corruption of a USB and how the users can repair Excel on flash drive that has been corrupted.

## **Reasons for USB inaccessibility**

Sometimes flash drives or USBs can become unresponsive due to numerous reasons. There are two types of corruption – logical and physical. Physical corruptions occur due to broken stems and connectors, broken circuits, NAND gate, not recognised, RAW, need to format, not accessible, and dead drives (no power supply).

One of the main reasons behind such an error could be that the USB drive has been infected by some virus. This can affect any file – not only the ones which are there in the USB drive but also the ones which are there in the PC/Laptop where you connect the USB drive. It is recommended that you scan the USB drive with reliable antivirus software to detect viruses.

There can be various other reasons that may make your USB corrupt or unresponsive. But there are very slim chances that you will be able to recover a flash drive that has physical damage. However, you can try to run the check disk on the USB drive to fix the drive. We will be discussing this as you read on.

## **Recovery Methods for Corrupted Flash Drives**

There are 3 tried and tested recovery methods. Try them and see which one works out for you.

1. **Restoring Excel Files from Windows backup**

To bring back your old Excel files, fixing up the corrupt file is your best option. Importantly note that this method would work only if your system’s Windows backup option has been enabled.

**Step-by-step process for restoring your older Excel files:**

- Connect your USB drive
- Go to “My Computer”->USB Drive->Check if the file exists
- Right click on the excel file and click on the restore previous versions

![Restore Previous Versions](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/restore-previous-version-of-Excel.jpg)

- You will now see a list of older versions which were created
- Select one the backups and click on “restore”

2. **Using Command Line to Recover Excel Files**

In case you are looking to repair Excel on flash drive, you can also resolve it by using the command line. Just follow the below steps to see if you can recover the excel files.

- Connect your USB Flash drive
- Open “Run” (press Windows+R) and then open “cmd”

![Windows+R cmd](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cmd.jpg)

- Type “attrib -h -r -s /s /d (USB Drive Letter):\\\*.\*” where the (USB Drive Letter) is the drive letter you can find using “My Computer”
- Once this has been completed, Windows will start repairing your files
- After the process gets over, try accessing the excel file to see if the data has been recovered

3. **Running a “Check Disk” on flash drives**

Follow the below steps while the USB flash drive has been plugged into your computer:

- Open “Run” and then open “cmd”
- Type in “chkdsk /X /f (USB Drive Letter)” where the “(USB Drive Letter)” is the letter of the corrupted USB Drive. You can get this letter easily from the “My Computer”.

![chkdsk  command prompt](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/check-disk.jpg)

It will now check your disk to and correct any corrupted records.

## **What if none of these methods works?**
