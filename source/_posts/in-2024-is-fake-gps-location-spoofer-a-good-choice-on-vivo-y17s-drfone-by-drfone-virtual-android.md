## Part 4: Fake GPS Location Spoofer User Reviews

To clarify the credibility of the **Fake GPS Location Spoofer app**, we also took our time to check what other users are saying.

Here, we've summarized some of the top reviews from real users on Playstore.

| **Platform** | **User** | **Remarks** | **Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _The company updates the app, in their own words, fixes the bug, and then expects you to pay again and again and again. Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with "routes' ' or "joystick" added. I wouldn't mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn't. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn't working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn't have import & export or a joystick. Import & export wouldn't be important if reliable._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | Douglas Buell | _This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the "no ads' ' mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I'm immediately shown an ad the instant I've clicked the message "Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!" Why include a feature that doesn't work? To force us to watch an ad you didn't have to work for? Ridiculous._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It's not difficult, but My Vivo Y17s keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won't be using google maps, set it up there, and you're all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works._ | 4.0/5.0 |

So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don't stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Vivo Y17s ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Vivo Y17s device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Vivo Y17s device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Vivo Y17s device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Vivo Y17s device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Vivo Y17s device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Vivo Y17s device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Vivo Y17s  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Vivo Y17s  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Vivo Y17s  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Vivo Y17s  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)
