**Step 1.** Start Dr. Fone's software on your computer and select "My backup" from the main menu.

**Step 2.** Preview the selected file and confirm. Click on Restore to Device it to your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro.

### The Bottom Line

Smartphones are a critical part of our personal and professional lives now. Keeping them updated, backed up, and fully functional is essential. If your phone has issues or you have forgotten your password, Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro hard reset is a reliable solution. However, it results in the wiping of data. On the other hand, you can use robust software like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) to solve your phone's performance or locking issues without data loss.
