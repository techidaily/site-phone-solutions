## **Why Does Excel Show or Display the Formula Not the Result?**

**Following are the possible reasons that may lead to the ‘Excel showing formula not result’ issue:**

1. You accidentally enabled “**Show Formulas**” in Excel.
2. The cell format in a spreadsheet is set to text.
3. ‘Automatic calculation’ feature in Excel is set to manual.
4. Excel thinks your formula is text (Syntax are not followed).
5. You type numbers in a cell with unnecessary formatting.

## **How to Fix ‘Excel Showing Formula Not Result’ Issue?**

### **Solution 1 – Disable Show Formulas**

If only the formula shows in Excel not result, check if you have accidentally or intentionally enabled ‘show formula’ feature of Excel. Instead of applying calculations and then showing results, this feature displays the actual text written by you.

You can use the ‘Show Formulas’ feature to quickly view all formulas, but if you are not aware of this feature, and enabled it accidentally, it can be a headache. To disable this mode, go to ‘**Formulas**’ and click on ‘**Show formula enabled**.’ If it’s previously enabled, it will be disabled by just clicking on it.

![Show Formula Enabled](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/show-formulas-1.jpg)

### **Solution 2 – Cell Format Set to Text**

Another possible reason that only formula shows in Excel not result could be that the cell format is set to text. This means that anything written in any format in that cell will be treated as regular text. If so, change the format to General or any other. To get Excel to recognize the change in the format, you may need to enter cell edit mode by clicking into the formula bar or just press F2.

![Enter Cell Edit Mode by Clicking into the Formula Bar](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/formula-f2.jpg)

### **Solution 3 – Change Calculation Options from ‘Manual’ to ‘Automatic’**

There is an “automatic calculation” feature in Excel, which tells Excel to do calculations automatically or manually. If ‘Excel formula is not showing results’, it may be because the automatic calculations feature is set to manual. This issue is not easily detected because it results in calculating formula in one cell but if you copy it to some other cell, it will retain the first calculation and will not recalculate on the base of the new location. To fix this, follow these steps:

- In Excel, click on the ‘**File**’ tab on the top left corner of the screen.
- In the window that opens, click on ‘**Options**’ from the left menu bar.
- From ‘Excel Options’ dialog box, select ‘**Formulas**’ from the left side menu and then change the ‘**Calculation options**’ to ‘**Automatic**’ if it’s currently set as ‘Manual’.

![Automatic Calculations Feature](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/calculation-options.jpg)

- Click on ‘**OK**’. This will redirect you to your sheet.

### **Solution 4 – Type Formula in the Right Format**

There is a proper way to tell Excel that your text is a formula. If you don’t write the formula in a particular format, Excel considers it as simple text and hence no calculations are performed according to it. For this reason, keep the following in mind when typing a formula:

- **Equal sign:** Every formula in Excel should start with an equal sign (=). If you miss it, Excel will mistake your formula as regular text.

- **Space before equal sign:** You are not supposed to enter any space before equal sign. Maybe a single space will be hard for us to detect, but it breaks the rule of writing formulas for Excel.

- **Formula wrapped in quotes:** You need to make sure that your formula is not wrapped in quotes. People usually make this mistake of writing a formula in quotes, but in Excel, quotes are used to signify text. So your formula won’t be evaluated. But you can add quotes inside formula if required, for example: =SUMIFS(F5:F9,G5:G9,”>30″).

- **Match all parentheses in a formula:** Arguments of Excel functions are entered in parenthesis. In complex cases, you may need to enter more sets of parenthesis. If those parentheses are not paired/closed properly, Excel may not be able to evaluate the entered formula.

- **Nesting limit:** If you are nesting two or more Excel functions into each other, for example using nested IF loop, remember the following rules:
  - Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, and 2007 versions only allow to use up to 64 nested functions.
  - Excel 2003 and lower versions only allow up to 7 nested functions.

### **Solution 5 – Enter Numbers without any Formatting**

When you use a number in the formula, make sure you don’t enter any decimal separator or currency sign, e.g. $, etc. In an Excel formula, a comma is used to separate arguments of a function and a dollar sign makes an absolute cell reference. Most of these special characters have built-in functions so avoid using them unnecessarily.

## **What to Do If the Manual Solutions Don’t Work?**

If you’ve tried out the manual solutions mentioned above but still unable to resolve the ‘Excel formula not showing result’ issue, you can try repairing your Excel file with the help of an automated [Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), such as **Stellar Repair for Excel**.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

It is easy to work with Microsoft Excel but sometimes, the application may create issues thereby hampering the smooth functioning of the workbook. One such issue is “unable to Save Excel Workbook”.

## Let’s take a look at the issue of Unable to Save Excel Workbook

### **Instance 1:**

In an organization, users connected to one of the servers (Windows 2008 R2) using Citrix – a Terminal Server configured with Windows 2008 R2 –and accessed their data through a File Server, also configured with Windows 2008R2. Since the connectivity to Shared Drive was established through a Terminal server, any conflict amongst the server configuration may create conflict in shared file.

This issue was discussed at length at one of the [Tech Forums](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/371563-excel-document-not-saved-issue), where the users were unable to access their workbooks stored on the shared drive. The File menu did not work. As a result, the users were forced to save the workbook by creating quick access shortcuts or locally on the desktop. In many cases, the saving option was ruled out completely.

### **Instance 2:**

A [similar problem](https://www.dell.com/support/article/in/en/indhs1/sln308103/unable-to-save-workbook-in-microsoft-excel?lang=en) was reported, wherein the users received an error when saving an Excel workbook after inserting a chart in an existing workbook (previously saved) or copying values from an existing workbook. A system is configured with Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 10 configuration. The issue arises when the user is unable to save the changes after editing in a saved spreadsheet. The following message displays on the screen:

![Image of Error message while trying to save excel file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Excel-Error.png)

Figure: Unable to Save Excel WorkBook Issue

**Further, if the user clicks ‘Continue’, the following error message is received:**

“Excel encountered errors during save. However, Excel was able to minimally save your file to <**filename.xlsx**\>”.

**Note:** This issue impacts build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later, and also only occurs with files that are stored locally, such as on the desktop. This problem does not occur if you manually enter values or insert a chart in a newly created workbook.

## Plausible reasons for the ‘Unable to save Excel workbook’ Issue

1. The issue was detected in Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 32-bit, Service Pack 14.0.6029.1000.
2. Excel version on the user system may or may not match with Excel version on File server.
3. The issue of ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ impacts only the Build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later.
4. In case of Issue 2, the problem surfaces when the user adds files, tables or charts in the locally saved excel files, such as on the desktop.

## Methods to fix the ‘Unable to Save Excel Workbook’ Issue

There may be an issue with the Build version or the Registry Values settings may not be appropriate, which does not allow the Excel workbooks to save.

**But, before starting to resolve the issue, verify the following:**

1. **The location where the file is to be saved may not have enough space to save the Excel file**: Check the available space and save again. You may also use the option of ‘Save As’ to save the file at a new location.
2. **Excel file may be a shared one where edits are not allowed by a specific user**: There are restrictions attached to documents and other files shared over the network. Check for these restrictions.
3. **Antivirus may interrupt in during file saving**: Antivirus in the system may not allow saving of the files. Request the system administrator to uninstall the antivirus and reinstall after saving.
4. **The file is not saved within 218 characters**: If the file is not saved due to the naming issue, then check the character length and try again.
5. **Differences in Windows versions** of the local system and those on network drive may cause excel not saved issues. Check that all the systems have the same configuration and are updated to the recently available versions.
6. **Excel spreadsheet is corrupt**: If none of the above factors have not caused hindrance in saving the file, then there may be a probability of [corruption in the Excel spreadsheet](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/simple-way-to-open-corrupt-excel-file-without-any-backup/).

Once verified, look for a healthy and restorable backup. If backup is missing, resolve the issue of “Unable to open Excel File” with manual settings on local system or through a reliable Excel repair software.

## **Conclusion**

‘Unable to save Excel file’ is a generic problem that may appear due to various reasons. In this blog post, we presented some of the actual instances reported by users on community forums.

Windows updates, the Build versions, the Service Packs of the local systems and those on the network drive must be either similar or in sync with each other. Any deviation may cause issues in accessing or saving the Microsoft files, as reported in Instance 1 is caused where user is unable to save Microsoft Excel file on the Network Drive. In case, the user is unable to save the file on network drive then the problem lies with the Registry value.

Another case is when the users receive an error while saving an Excel workbook after they insert a chart in an existing workbook or copying values from an existing workbook. This issue is known to affect build Version 1707 (Build 8326.2086) and later, and only occurs with locally stored files.

When a user is unable to save a specific Excel file, then the problem can be resolved using the manual methods or the software based utility. The mode of repair depends upon the level of corruption in Excel file.

Hence, it is suggested to analyze the nature of the problem and decide an appropriate resolution method.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

When opening a workbook in Microsoft Excel 2003 or later, you may encounter an error message,

_“Damage to the file was so extensive that repairs were not possible. Excel attempted to recover your formulas and values, but some data may have been lost or corrupted.”_

![](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.png)

The error message may also occur while exporting an Excel file. Let’s find out what causes this error and what we can do to fix it.

## Reasons Behind “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error

Your Excel file may be corrupt, oversized, virus-afflicted, etc., which can trigger this error and make the repair impossible. Below are some common reasons.

- Large or oversized excel files hindering export
- Data restore errors
- Field length of a cell is more than 256 characters
- Software conflicts, viruses, network failure
- Unable to open files in upgraded versions
- Errors on output exceeding 64000 rows
- Limited system resources (such as RAM, internal memory)

In a nutshell, the error generally happens if Excel discovers unreadable content, which may also interrupt file saving in Excel.

## How to Resolve “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error?

Here are a few methods you can follow to fix or resolve the Excel repair error.  

### Method 1: Perform Basic Troubleshooting

When opening a corrupt workbook, Microsoft Excel automatically initiates the file recovery mode to repair the corrupt file. However, if it fails to perform automatic recovery, then follow these basic troubleshooting steps:

- This error mainly happens when you try to open the Excel file in an upgraded version.  Try to open the file in an older version of Excel. You might be able to open it.
- Try saving the file with a different file name.
- Use a different file extension to save the file.
- You can save the Excel file as HTML and then open it. However, an HTML file might not save conditional formatting.
- Close other opened applications on the system which may be causing the error.
- Select less data for export at once.
- Delete worksheets if copied from another document; for instance, delete any file or screenshots you have imported.
- Open the file on another system.

If the error persists, then use the manual method to repair a workbook using the below steps:

- Go to the “**File**” tab.

![Go the File Tab in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.png)

- Select **Open** and select the damaged spreadsheet from the **Recent Workbooks** section on the right, if listed. However, if you cannot find the file in the **Recent Workbooks** section, click on “**Browse**” and choose the **corrupted workbook**.

![Click on Open and browse the corrupted workbook](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3.png)

- Click the drop-down arrow on the **Open** tab and select **Open and Repair**.

![after selecting the corrupt excel, click on the drop-down next to Open and click on Open and Repair](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.png)

### Method 2: Check if exporting a Heavy File is Causing Resource Limitations in Excel

Sometimes, when you try to export an Excel sheet carrying a huge database, you may face memory errors in older Excel versions like Excel 2003. Here, you’ll have to decrease the amount of data as Excel 2003 does not permit exporting extensive data beyond a limit. However, modern versions such as Excel 2007, 2010 & 2016 allow exporting a large amount of data and utilize more RAM than the older versions.

Following are some other workarounds:

- Use a lesser number of query presentation fields to re-generate the query. Then, again re-enter those fields.
