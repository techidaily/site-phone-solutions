### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update.
