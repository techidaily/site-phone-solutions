Many users have reported encountering the “cannot insert object” error while adding/embedding objects into the Excel file. It usually occurs when using Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to add content (PDF, Microsoft documents) from external applications to worksheet. The error can also occur when using ActiveX control in Excel. Below, we’ll explain why you cannot insert object into Excel sheet and how to troubleshoot the issue.

## **Why the “Cannot Insert Object” Error Occurs?**

- Macro Settings can prevent the insertion of objects into a workbook.
- The Excel file in which you are trying to add an element is corrupted.
- The object (you are inserting into the workbook) is damaged.
- Object size limitations.
- System’s insufficient memory might prevent new objects’ addition.
- Incompatible Excel file format.
- Add-ins controls are disabled.
- Incompatible or faulty Add-ins.
- Issue with Security Settings.

## **Methods to Fix the “Cannot Insert Object” Error in Excel**

You may encounter the “Cannot insert object” error when trying to add an element stored on a network. It can occur due to issues with the file link, such as incorrect file location. In such a case, you can check the link by selecting the **link to file** option from the **Insert** tab.

Sometimes, the error can occur if the file in which you are trying to insert the object is locked and password-protected. In this case, you can [unprotect the Excel file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6). If the issue still persists, then you can follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Check and Change Restricted Security Settings

Excel provides security settings to protect your workbook. Sometimes, these settings can prevent inserting objects in the file. You can change the security settings to allow Excel to insert objects. To do so, follow these steps:

- Open your Excel application.
- Locate the **File** and then click **Options**.
- In **Excel Options**, click **Trust Center**.

![Trust Center In Excel Options](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trust-center-in-excel-options.jpg)

- Click **Trust Center Settings**.
- In the **Trust Center Settings** window, select **Protected View** from the left pane.

![Click Protected View In Trust Center](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-protected-view-in-trust-center.jpg)

- Under **Protected View**, unselect the below three options:
- Enable Protected View for files originating from the internet.
- Enable Protected View for files located in potentially unsafe locations.
- Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments.

![Select All Options Under Protected View](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/select-all-options-under-protected-view.jpg)

- Click **OK**.
- Once you’re done with this, click on **Macro Settings** in the **Trust Center** window.
- Under **Macro Settings**, make sure **“Disable all macros without notification”** is not selected. If it is selected, then unselect it. After that, click **OK**.

- Restart Excel to apply the changes.

### **Method 2: Uninstall Microsoft Office Updates**

You can also encounter the “Cannot insert object” error in Excel after installing MS Office updates. It might be due to the issues with the installed updates. To fix this, you can uninstall the recently installed Office updates. To uninstall the Office updates, follow these steps:

- Go to the system’s Control Panel.
- Click **Programs** and then click **Program and Features.**
- Search for “**View Installed Updates**” and click on the desired Office updates.
- Right-click on it and then click **Uninstall**.
- Follow the uninstallation steps on the screen.
- Once the process is complete, restart the system.

### **Method 3: Check Memory Usage**

The “Cannot insert object” issue can also occur if your system is low on memory. You can check and close unnecessary processes and applications running in the background to free up memory. To do so, follow these steps:

- Press **CTRL + ALT + DEL** on the keyboard and click **Task Manager**.
- Click on the **Processes** tab and search for any unnecessary processes.
- Right-click on the process and then select **End Task**.
- Restart Excel to see if the issue is fixed.

### **Method 4: Check Excel File Size**

If your Excel file size exceeds the prescribed limit, it can also lead to the “Cannot insert Excel object” error. So, check the Excel file size. You can reduce the file size by removing unnecessary objects, such as formulas or images.

### **Method 5: Check and Change Excel ActiveX Settings**

You can get the “Excel cannot insert object” error if your Excel file contains macros, controls, and other interactive buttons. It usually occurs if the ActiveX Controls option is disabled. You can check and change the ActiveX Settings to fix the issue. Here are the steps:

- Open your Excel application.
- Navigate to **File** and then click **Options**.
- In **Excel Options**, click the **Trust Center** tab.
- In the **Trust Center Settings**, click **ActiveX Settings**.
- Under ActiveX Settings, make sure the “Enable all controls without restrictions and without prompting” option is selected.

![select enable all controls without restrictions under activexsettings](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/select-enable-all-controls-without-restrictions-under-activexsettings.png)

- If the option is not selected, then select it and click **OK**.
- Restart the Excel and check if the error is fixed or not.

### **Method 6: Repair the Excel Workbook**

The “Cannot insert object” error can occur if the object you are trying to insert is corrupted or the file in which you are inserting the object is damaged. If the issue has occurred due to a corrupted Excel file, then you can repair the file using the Open and Repair utility in MS Excel. To use this Microsoft-inbuilt utility, follow these steps:

- In the Excel application, go to the **File** tab and then click **Open**.
- Click **Browse** to choose the affected file.
- The **Open** dialog box is displayed. Click on the corrupted file.
- Click on the arrow next to the **Open** button and then click **Open and Repair**.
- Click on **Repair.**

- After repair, a message will appear (as shown in the below figure).

![Click Close Option In Repair Message](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/click-close-option-in-repair-message.jpg)

## How to Resolve 'Excel found unreadable content in filename.xlsx' Error in MS Excel?

When opening an Excel spreadsheet in MS Office 2010/2007, you may get the following error message:

"Excel found unreadable content in '\[filename\].xlsx'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes."

![Excel Found Unreadable Content Error Message](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-found-unreadable-content-error-message-image-1.png)

On clicking 'Yes', you may face any of these scenarios:

**_Note:_** _If you choose to click 'No', then open your MS Excel application and click file > Open. When the Open dialog box opens, browse and select the file showing the 'Excel found unreadable content' error and then choose 'Open and Repair' option. If this didn't help, try using a third-party Excel repair tool to save time troubleshooting the issue and restoring the file with all its data intact._

**Scenario 1:** The following message may pop-up.

"Excel was able to open the file by repairing or removing the unreadable content. Excel recovered your formulas and cell values, but

[<u>some data may have been lost</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

## Workarounds to Resolve the 'Excel found unreadable content in filename.xls' Error

There is no permanent solution to fix the 'Excel found unreadable content' error. But, following are some workarounds you can try to resolve the error.

**_Note:_** _Before you try any of these workarounds, run Excel with administrator privileges and try opening the Excel file that is throwing the 'unreadable content' error. If this doesn't fix the error, proceed with the workarounds below._

### **Workaround 1 – Try Opening the File in Excel 2003**

Sometimes a problem in the current Excel version might prevent a file from opening. To resolve this error, try opening the problematic file in Excel 2003. If the file opens, save the data in a web page file format (.html) and then try opening the .html file in MS Excel 2010/2007. The detailed step-wise instructions are as follows:

- Open the .xls file in Excel 2003.
- When the file opens, click on File > Save.
- In the 'Save As' dialog box, choose Web Page (.html) as the 'Save as type' and then click 'Save.' Doing so will save everything from your .xls file, opened with 2003, in .html file format.
- Open the .html file in Excel 2010/2007. And then, save the file with .xlsx extension with a new name to avoid overwriting the original file.

Now, open the Excel 2010/2007 file and check if the error is fixed. If not, use the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Make the Excel File 'Read-only'**

Try to open your '.xlsx' file by making it 'read-only'. Follow these steps:

- In Excel, click 'File' from the main menu.
- Select 'Save' for a new document or 'Save As' for a previously saved document in the screen that appears.

![Excel File Saving Options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-file-saving-options-image-3.png)

- From the 'Save As' dialog box, click Tools > General Options.

![Open General Options In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Open-general-options-in-excel-image-4.png)

- Click on the 'Read-only recommended' checkbox to make the document read-only and then click 'OK'.

![Select Read Only Recommended Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Select-read-only-recommended-option-image-5.png)

Now open a new '.xlsx' file and copy everything from the corrupt Excel file to this new file. Finally, save this file and try to open it again.

### **Workaround 3 – Move Excel File to a New Folder**

Some users have reported that they could open their Excel file, following the 'Excel unreadable content' error, by simply moving the file to a different folder and saving it under a new name. You can also move the affected file to a new folder and try opening it. If this didn't help resolve the error, follow the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Install Visual Basic Component**

At times, it is seen that installing the 'Visual Basic' component of MS Office 2010 resolves the 'Excel found unreadable content 2010' error. To do so, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Control Panel > Programs and select Microsoft Office 2010.
- Click 'Change' and then select 'Add or Remove Programs'.
- Next, click the 'plus' sign provided next to Office Shared Features.
- Click 'Visual Basic for Applications'. After that, right-click and choose 'Run from My Computer' and hit the 'Continue' button.
- Reboot your system when this process finishes.

Now check if the issue has been resolved or not.

## \[Solved\] Excel Spreadsheet Disappears after Opening

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing ‘Excel spreadsheet disappears after opening’ issue. The problem occurs when attempting to open an Excel file by double-clicking on the file icon or name. The Excel file opens blank grey screen.

![Excel blank screen](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img1.jpg)

Figure 1 - Excel Blank Screen

## **User Instances of ‘Excel Open But Can’t See Spreadsheet’ Issue**

**Instance 1:** The user said that _“Excel 2016 opens to a blank screen and everything is greyed out. Ribbons at the top of Excel are also not present”._

**Instance 2:** The user reported that _“Attempting to open a spreadsheet, either by double-clicking the file or by opening Excel, it opens but only a blank Excel window is visible. When trying to save that particular file, Excel behaves as though there is no file open at all and all the file saving options, such as save, save as, print, etc. are greyed out.”_

## **Causes Behind ‘Excel Open But Can’t See Spreadsheet’ Issue & the Solutions Thereof**

Following are some of the possible reasons behind the ‘Excel open but can’t see spreadsheet’ issue, along with their solutions:

### **Cause 1: Excel File is Hidden**

You may have saved the Excel sheet as a hidden document.

### **Solution: Unhide Excel File**

Verify if your Excel worksheet is hidden by following these steps:

- In Excel, click the **View** tab, and then click **Unhide**.

Note: If the ‘Hide’ tab under the View menu is greyed out, the sheet you’re trying to open is not hidden. In that case, proceed to the next workaround.

![unhide excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img2.jpg)

Figure 2 - Unhide Excel File

- A dialog box will pop-up showing the worksheet name that can be unhidden. For instance, below is an image of Unhide box that lists ‘Daily\_Reports’ spreadsheet under Unhide workbook.

![unhide excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img3.jpg)

Figure 3 – Select and Unhide Excel Workbook

- Click **OK** to unhide your Excel sheet.

If this fails to work, there’s a possibility that the spreadsheet window pane may have slided to one side of the visible desktop. To bring back the displayed area, click the ‘Arrange All’ option under the View tab. If the issue persists, try the next solution.

### **Cause 2: Ignore Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Option is Enabled**

Another reason behind the ‘Excel opens to a blank screen’ issue could be that the “Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)” checkbox is checked in Excel options.

Usually, when you double-click an Excel file, a DDE message is sent to Excel instructing it to open that particular file. But, if you have the ‘Ignore DDE’ option selected, the DDE message sent to Excel to open a workbook is ignored. As a result, the Excel workbook opens a blank screen.

### **Solution: Uncheck the Ignore DDE Option**

Make sure that the ‘Ignore DDE’ option is unchecked by performing these steps:

Note: Skip these steps for Excel 2019 and Excel Office 365.

- In your Excel window, click **File** > **Options**.

![Excel options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img4.jpg)

- From the left-side of the ‘Options’ window, choose **Advanced**.

![Excel Options Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img5.jpg)

Figure 5 - Excel Options Window

- In ‘Advanced’ window, locate the **General** section, and then uncheck the “Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)” checkbox.

![uncheck ignore DDE](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img6.jpg)

Figure 6 - Uncheck Ignore Other Applications that use DDE

- Click **OK** to apply the changes.

If these steps don’t work, proceed to the next workaround.

### **Cause 3: Issue within Office Program**

Sometimes, problem within your Microsoft Office program might cause Excel to behave oddly and may result in an Excel spreadsheet disappeared issue.

### **Solution: Repair Office Program**

Try repairing your Office program by executing the steps listed below, based on your Windows OS:

**For Windows 10:**

- Type Settings in the Windows search box.
- Click **Settings**.

If repairing your Office installation fails to resolve the issue, continue to solution 4.

### **Cause 4: Problematic Excel and COM Add-ins**

Sometimes, Excel and COM add-ins may cause Excel file open a blank grey screen problem.

### **Solution: Disable the Add-ins**

Disabling the Excel and COM add-ins one at a time may help resolve the problem. The steps are as follows:

- Click the **File** menu in your Excel file and select
- From ‘Excel Options’ left-side panel, click **Add-Ins**, and then choose **COM Add-ins** from the ‘Manage’ drop-down. Click the **Go**

- Click the **Change button next to the ‘Opens with’ option.**
- Click **More apps**.
- From the list of applications, select the desired app and then check the **Always use this app** Click **OK**.

**For Windows 8:**

- Open **Control Panel**, click **Default Programs**, and then select **Set your default programs**.

## Resolve Compile Error in Hidden Module in Excel: Causes & Solutions

The hidden module in Excel refers to a container with VBA codes, custom queries, and complex macros. The compile error in a hidden (protected) module in the Excel worksheet usually occurs when doing different activities on a macro-enabled sheet, such as merging .xls files. The error can result in macros execution failure. You need to quickly resolve this compile error to restore full functionality of the VBA code. Below, we’ll be discussing the solutions to fix this Excel error. But before that, let’s see why this error occurs.

You may encounter the Compile error in hidden module due to one of the following reasons:

- The code in the workbook is not compatible with the Excel application.
- Manual queries created in a previous version are no longer compatible with your current version of Excel.
- Missing references.
- Invalid .exe files (control information cache files) are automatically created with ActiveX control insertion in Excel file.
- Protected module is corrupted.
- The workbook with hidden module is damaged or corrupted.
- Incompatible add-ins.
- Incompatible Excel file version.
- The module is protected or password-protected.
- Missing or corrupted mscomctl.ocx file.

Excel can throw the compile error while compiling the code that exists in the protected module. So, first check the error and identify the hidden module that is creating the issue. You can unprotect the module. Also, ensure that you have permission to access the VBA code in the module. If the error still exists, follow the below troubleshooting methods.

### Method 1: Re-register ActiveX Control Files or mscomctl.ocx Files

You can get the compile error in the Excel file, containing the VBA code related to ActiveX controls or OCX files. The ActiveX control files and OCX files (mscomctl.ocx files) are the components of Microsoft’s standard controls library. The compile error in the hidden module can occur if these files are missing. In this case, you can use the Regsvr32 tool to re-register the OCX files. The [Regsvr32](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/how-to-use-the-regsvr32-tool-and-troubleshoot-regsvr32-error-messages-a98d960a-7392-e6fe-d90a-3f4e0cb543e5) is a command-line utility to register and unregister OLE controls in the Windows registry.

### Method 2: Delete .exd Files

 The .exd files are temporary files created by Excel when inserting ActiveX controls objects. These temporary files can lead to a compile error if they are corrupted. So, if this issue has occurred, particularly in the Excel file containing ActiveX controls, then deleting .exd files might fix the issue. To delete the .exd file, follow the below steps:

- First, open the **Run** window by pressing the Windows+R keys.

![Open The Run Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/open-the-run-window.jpg)
