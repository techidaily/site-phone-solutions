## How to Reset Honor X50i without Losing Data

Nothing good lasts forever, not even your all-singing, all-dancing new Android smartphone. The warning signs are obvious, apps taking forever to load, constant force close notifications, and a battery life shorter than an episode of Westworld. If you recognize these symptoms then listen up, because your phone may be headed for a meltdown and there's only one thing left to do. It's time to reset your Android phone.

Before taking the plunge, there are a number of factors to consider. We've put together a quick guide to let you know what you need to know... and what you need to do. Before we start deleting stuff, however, it's important to understand what a Factory reset is.

## Part 1: What is Factory Reset?

There are two types of reset for every Android device, soft and hard resets. A [soft reset](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) is just a way to force the Android operating system to shut down in the event of a freeze and you only risk losing any data which wasn't saved prior to the reset.

A hard reset, also known as a factory reset and a master reset, returns the Honor X50i device to the condition it was in when it left the factory. Performing a factory reset will permanently delete any and all personal data you have on your device. This includes any personal settings, apps, pictures, documents, and music stored on your device. A factory reset is irreversible, which means before considering taking this step, it is a good idea to back your data and settings up. A factory reset is a great way to purge buggy updates and other malfunctioning software and can give your phone a new lease of life.

### Signs You Need to Reset Phone

You'll probably already know if your phone needs a reset, but if you're unsure, look for some of the following signs. If you recognize any of the following symptoms then a factory reset is probably a good idea.

1. If your [phone is running slowly](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/android-phone-slow.html) and you've already tried deleting Apps and data, but it hasn't resolved anything.
2. If your [Apps are crashing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/apps-keeps-crashing-android.html) or you keep getting 'force close' notifications from your operating system.
3. If your Apps are taking longer to load than usual, or your browser is running slow.
4. If you find your battery life is worse than usual and you need to charge your phone more often.
5. If you are selling, exchanging, or just giving your phone away. If you don’t reset it, the new user can gain access to cached passwords, personal details, and even your pictures and videos.

Remember factory resetting will erase everything on your device, so it's essential that you back up anything you can't afford to lose.

## Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset

There are a number of Android data backup software for PC out there. Having a Google account will help you save your contacts and settings, but it won't save your pictures, documents, or music. There are numerous cloud-based systems available like Dropbox and Onedrive where your data is saved onto a cloud-based server, but you'll need a data connection or wi-fi to restore to your device and of course, you are trusting a third party with your data. We recommend [Dr.Fone Basic](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). It's easy to use and will save everything and best of all you know exactly where it is.

Step 1. Press and hold the Volume up button and the Power button at the same time. The phone will now boot in Recovery Mode.

![factory reset from recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/enter-recovery-mode.jpg)

### Method 3. Resetting Your Phone Remotely With Android Device Manager

You can also perform a factory reset by using the Android Device manager App. Obviously, you'll need to have Android Device Manager installed on your phone for which you'll need a Google Account.

Step 1. Sign in to the App and locate your device on whatever medium you are currently using. With Android Device Manager it is possible to Factory Reset a device remotely by using a PC or other device, but your phone must be logged into your Google account and have an active internet connection.

Step 2. Select erase all data. This is particularly effective if you have lost or had your phone stolen and your device is running Android 5.1 or higher as whoever has your phone will still need your Google Password to be able to reset the Phone.

![factory reset from recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-device-mamager-erase.jpg)

Please note: this reset will also delete Android Device Manager and you will therefore be unable to locate or track your device.

## Part 4: Restoring Your Phone After a Reset
