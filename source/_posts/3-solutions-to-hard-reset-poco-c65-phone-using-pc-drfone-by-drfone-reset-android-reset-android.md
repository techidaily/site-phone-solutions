## Using Poco C65 Hard Reset in What Situations?

Although Poco C65 phones provide a lot of storage and support SD cards, you can only erase unwanted data if you run out of space. Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an **Poco C65 hard reset**. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.

### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don't like an update's new features and settings.
