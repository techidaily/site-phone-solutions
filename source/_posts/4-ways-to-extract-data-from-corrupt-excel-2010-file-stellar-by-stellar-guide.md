Imagine the frustration of an employee if an Excel workbook he took hours to complete became corrupted for some reason threatening to erase all the data saved in it. Not just that, a corrupted Excel workbook can wreak havoc for the organization too since it poses a risk of permanently deleting critical business information like work records or employee trackers.

Unless a backup of all important Excel files exists, recovering data lost due to damage/corruption to them is next to impossible. However, we’ve conducted some research and found some pretty neat hacks to help you extract data from corrupt excel files without much hassle.

## Primary reasons triggering Excel file corruption

As we always point out, to solve a problem for good, getting to its root is imperative. Here are the main reasons that cause Excel file corruption. Knowing these reasons can help you keep Excel corruption at bay for a considerably long time.

- Abrupt system shutdown when you’re editing an Excel sheet
- Bugs / Defects in your Excel application or installation
- Hardware failures like bad sectors on the hard drive where Excel sheets are saved
- Virus Infection / Malware Attack
- Excessive data storage within a single Excel file
- Faulty Excel Macros and CSE Formulas

Depending upon the extent of damage, there can be several ways to perform corrupt Excel file repair.

## How to repair corrupt Excel files?

There are a couple of manual methods that can help you [repair corrupt Excel files](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

1. **If the damaged Excel sheet can be opened, immediately save its copy; thereafter**:
    - Open it with a later version of Excel and save it as a new workbook.
    - If this doesn’t work, open it in Excel’s latest version and save the workbook in HTML or HTM format.
    - Once this is done, reopen the HTML file and save again in XLS format.
    - Lastly, open the file and try saving it in SLK format (symbolic link)

**Note:** It is important to note that saving an Excel workbook in HTML format causes loss of features like custom views, scenarios, unused styles or number formats, natural language formulas, data consolidation settings, custom function categories, etc. In SYLK format only the active worksheet is saved so if using this method, you’ll need to repeat these steps for each worksheet.

2. **Use Excel’s inbuilt Repair function as follows:**
    - Launch Microsoft Excel and go to **Office button -> Open**
    - In the Open dialog box, select the damaged Excel file
    - On the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog box, you will find a drop-down next to **Open** Click on it and select **Open and Repair**
    - This will launch the inbuilt Repair module of Excel and you’ll see a dialog box asking you to select an option from **Repair** or **Extract Data**
    - Click on **Repair** to initiate the repair process.
    - If this doesn’t work, repeat steps 1-4, and when Excel asks you to select an option, select **Extract Data** from corrupt excel file. Thereafter, follow the instruction Excel shows and you should be able to retrieve your data, but you may end up losing some formulas.
3. **If you cannot open the Excel, download Spreadsheet viewer from the Microsoft website and open the file using this program. Thereafter copy all data into a new Excel.**

**Note:** This method will cause much of your formatting, formulas, and more to be lost.

4. **You can download Open Office from its official website OpenOffice.org and try opening the Excel in it. The two programs are very similar so all data should automatically align in the correct place and with the correct formatting.**

**Note:** With this method, VBA code cannot be recovered due to incompatibility between OpenOffice.org and Excel.

## Full-proof method for corrupt Excel file repair

When opening a workbook in Microsoft Excel 2003 or later, you may encounter an error message,

_“Damage to the file was so extensive that repairs were not possible. Excel attempted to recover your formulas and values, but some data may have been lost or corrupted.”_

![](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.png)

The error message may also occur while exporting an Excel file. Let’s find out what causes this error and what we can do to fix it.

## Reasons Behind “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error

Your Excel file may be corrupt, oversized, virus-afflicted, etc., which can trigger this error and make the repair impossible. Below are some common reasons.

- Large or oversized excel files hindering export
- Data restore errors
- Field length of a cell is more than 256 characters
- Software conflicts, viruses, network failure
- Unable to open files in upgraded versions
- Errors on output exceeding 64000 rows
- Limited system resources (such as RAM, internal memory)

In a nutshell, the error generally happens if Excel discovers unreadable content, which may also interrupt file saving in Excel.

## How to Resolve “Damage to the File Was So Extensive That Repairs Were Not Possible” Error?

Here are a few methods you can follow to fix or resolve the Excel repair error.  

### Method 1: Perform Basic Troubleshooting

When opening a corrupt workbook, Microsoft Excel automatically initiates the file recovery mode to repair the corrupt file. However, if it fails to perform automatic recovery, then follow these basic troubleshooting steps:

- This error mainly happens when you try to open the Excel file in an upgraded version.  Try to open the file in an older version of Excel. You might be able to open it.
- Try saving the file with a different file name.
- Use a different file extension to save the file.
- You can save the Excel file as HTML and then open it. However, an HTML file might not save conditional formatting.
- Close other opened applications on the system which may be causing the error.
- Select less data for export at once.
- Delete worksheets if copied from another document; for instance, delete any file or screenshots you have imported.
- Open the file on another system.

If the error persists, then use the manual method to repair a workbook using the below steps:

- Go to the “**File**” tab.

![Go the File Tab in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2.png)

- Select **Open** and select the damaged spreadsheet from the **Recent Workbooks** section on the right, if listed. However, if you cannot find the file in the **Recent Workbooks** section, click on “**Browse**” and choose the **corrupted workbook**.

![Click on Open and browse the corrupted workbook](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-3.png)

- Click the drop-down arrow on the **Open** tab and select **Open and Repair**.

![after selecting the corrupt excel, click on the drop-down next to Open and click on Open and Repair](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-4.png)

### Method 2: Check if exporting a Heavy File is Causing Resource Limitations in Excel

Sometimes, when you try to export an Excel sheet carrying a huge database, you may face memory errors in older Excel versions like Excel 2003. Here, you’ll have to decrease the amount of data as Excel 2003 does not permit exporting extensive data beyond a limit. However, modern versions such as Excel 2007, 2010 & 2016 allow exporting a large amount of data and utilize more RAM than the older versions.

Following are some other workarounds:

- Use a lesser number of query presentation fields to re-generate the query. Then, again re-enter those fields.
- Decrease the multi-line string field data text up to 8000 characters.

### Method 3: Copy Macros and Data to Another Workbook (Empty) in an Advanced Excel version

If the issue is occurring due to version incompatibility, i.e., if the file opens easily in the older version but shows errors in the new version. You can:

**Use the older version to open the file or copy the data or macros in an empty workbook of the new version of Excel.**  

#### Copying the Macros in the Workstation

In Microsoft Excel, you can use the **Visual Basic Editor** to open the workbook with macro on another workbook by copying the macro. Both VBA tools and Macros appear in the Developer section of the excel file. This option is disabled by default. So first, you need to enable it.

Follow the instructions to enable it:

- Open Excel and go to **File** > **Options.**

![In the file menu, go to Options](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-5.png)

- Click “**Customize Ribbon.**”

- Click **OK**.

Once you have enabled the **Developer** tab, follow the steps to copy the macro from one workbook to another:

- First, open both the workbooks- the workbook containing the macro and the workbook in which you need to copy the macros.
- Locate the **Developer** tab.

- Excel keeps crashing

Follow these solutions in the given order. In case a method doesn't work, move to the next one.

### Solution 1: Restart Excel in Safe Mode

By starting MS Excel in safe mode, you can run the program without loading the Excel add-ins and with limited features. But COM add-ins are excluded.

To launch Excel in safe mode, close MS Excel and follow these steps,

![type excel /safe](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel8.jpg)

Now try to open and access the Excel file and check if the issue is resolved. If it's not, head on to the next solution.

### Solution 2: Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins

In case Excel doesn't crash in Safe Mode, it's possible that some faulty add-ins are the culprit behind frequent Excel crash and freeze. These Excel add-ins may interfere or conflict with the Excel program.

![Check and Remove Faulty Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel9.jpg)

Find and remove the faulty add-in. It can resolve the issue. To do so, follow these steps,

- Restart Excel in normal mode and go to File> Options> Add-ins
- Choose COM Add-ins from the drop-down and click Go

![COM Add-ins](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel10.jpg)

- Uncheck all the checkboxes and click OK

![Uncheck all the check boxes](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel11.jpg)

- Restart Excel and check if the issue is resolved
-  If Excel doesn't crash or freeze anymore, open COM Add-ins and enable one add-in at a time followed by Excel restart. Then observe Excel for freeze or crash problem

This will help you find out the faulty add-in, which is causing the problem. Remove the add-in which is causing the problem to resolve the issue. If that doesn't fix, move to the next solution.

### Solution 3: Check and Install the Latest Updates

If you haven't set Windows to Download and Install Updates automatically, do it now.

Apart from updating the operating system, latest Windows updates sometimes fixes bugs for other applications installed on the system such as MS Office. Often installing an important update that you might have missed may correct the Excel crash problem.

You can also update MS Office manually. Follow these steps,

Go to File > Account

 Under Product Information, select Update Options and click Update Now

![Product Information](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel12.jpg)

If you have installed MS Excel from Microsoft Store, open the store and update your Office applications.

NOTE: This also works if you can't open Excel file or Excel crashes after Windows upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10.

After installing the latest MS Office updates, check if Excel works fine. If not, head to the next solution.

### Solution 4: Clear Conditional Formatting Rules

If a sheet is causing Excel to freeze or crash, there might be a problem with that particular sheet. In such a case, you may try clearing the Conditional Formatting rules. The steps are as follows,

- Under Home, click 'Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules\> Clear Rules from Entire Sheet'

![Conditional Formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel13.jpg)

- You may repeat this step for all other sheets in the Excel workbook
- Then click File> Save as and save the Sheet as a new file at a different location

This avoids overwriting or making changes to the original Excel file. Once done, try working on the sheet.

If this doesn't work out, move to the next solution.

### Solution 5: Remove Multiple Cell Formatting and Styles

If a workbook is being shared and edited by others on different platforms then it's possible that many cells are formatted differently. This can cause issues with Excel such as crash and freeze. It can also lead to Excel file corruption. The problem mostly occurs when a workbook contains multiple worksheets using different formatting.

You can [follow this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/troubleshoot/excel/too-many-different-cell-formats-in-excel) to remove different cell formats and styles, and then open the Excel file.

### Solution 6: Disable Microsoft Excel Animation

Animations require additional processing power and resources. By disabling animations in Excel, you may resolve Excel freeze and crash issue. This also improves MS Excel performance.

To disable the animations in MS Excel, follow these steps:

- Go to File > Options
- Click 'Advanced' and check 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'animation

![Disable hardware graphics acceleration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel14.jpg)

- Click 'OK' to close the window and then restart MS Excel

This has helped many users in fixing the Excel crash issue. If it doesn't work for you, head to the next solution.

### Solution 7: Check If Excel File is Generated by a Third-Party Application

There are applications which you may have used to generate Excel files to fetch data. For instance, downloading data from Google Analytics in Excel format.

Sometimes, these Excel files are not generated correctly by such third-party apps. Thus, some features in Excel may not work as intended when you access the files in MS Excel.

In such a case, you should get in touch with the app developer for help with the file or use Stellar Repair for Excel to repair such Excel files.

### Solution 8: Check If Antivirus or Other Apps are Conflicting with MS Excel

Ensure your antivirus is up-to-date and not conflicting with MS Excel. An outdated antivirus tool may conflict with Excel which can cause the application to hang, freeze, or crash.

- Update your antivirus
- Try disabling the add-in or integration between Excel and antivirus. See if it works

Alternatively, you may disable the anti-virus tool temporarily to check if it is the culprit behind Excel performance issue and crash. If that resolves the problem, get in touch with your antivirus vendor and report the problem.

They might provide you with a better solution or workaround to fix this problem without disabling the antivirus protection.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Disabling or altering antivirus protection makes your PC vulnerable to malicious attacks and virus or malware intrusion.

### Solution 9: Clean Boot Windows to Inspect the Cause Behind Excel Crash

When Windows boot, it starts several processes, services, and application during start up automatically, which runs in the background.

These startup apps and services can interfere with other applications such as MS Excel. To find out if that's the cause behind Excel crash, you can perform a Clean Boot.

This helps you identify processes, services, or applications that are conflicting with Excel. Steps to perform Clean Boot are as follows,

- Press Windows key + R, type MSConfig, and press 'Enter'
- In System Configuration window, click on the General tab and choose Selective startup

![System Configuration](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel15.jpg)

Uncheck 'Load startup items' and click 'OK'

After this, close all running applications and restart your PC

Check if the crash problem with Excel is resolved. Uninstall the conflicting apps or update them. If your issue is not resolved, follow the next solution.

### Solution 10: Repair or Reinstall MS Office

Repairing Office programs may also resolve Excel crash issues if caused by damaged MS Excel program or MS Office files. The steps are as follow,

- Close all MS Office apps and open the Control Panel
- Click Uninstall a program under Programs

![Uninstall a program](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel16.jpg)

- Click on Microsoft Office and then click on the Change option
- Choose 'Quick repair' and then select 'Repair'
