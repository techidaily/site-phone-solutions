## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Poco M6 Pro 4G

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

In this time of modern technology, it is hard to be away from your phone or even leave it at home.

When we message our friends, have a video call with our family, or just simply order food to eat at home, you can do all of them on the Poco M6 Pro 4G device in your palm.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

![apply fluctuation mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png)

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Step 2Import a GPX File

For importing a GPX file on the platform, click the **Import** button on the right pane. As this opens a window, select the GPX file you wish to import to the platform.

![import gpx file to the platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Step 3Wait for the File to be Read

Wait for a moment until Dr.Fone - Virtual Location recognizes the specific locations within the GPX file and displays them on the map.

![wait for gpx file to load](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

### Part 6: Historical Records

Step 1Open Historical Records

Click the **Historical Records** button on the right pane to access the entire history involving the connected smartphone and the location spoofing platform.
