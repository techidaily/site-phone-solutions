  AVCHD is a form of video compression that allows the large data files created by HD video recording to be captured and saved on digital media such as hard disk drives and flash memory cards. It usually comes with .mts file extension. If you would like to play AVCHD .mts files on your Xiaomi 13T, but failed for some reason, we would recommend converting the AVCHD media to a format that is well supported by Xiaomi 13T first, such as H.264 codec encoded MP4 format, which Xiaomi 13T will open and play well. Here’s a quick guide displaying how to process AVCHD to MP4 conversion for Xiaomi 13T.
