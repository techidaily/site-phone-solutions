## Part 4: Hard reset Android using Android Device Manager (Find My Device)

When someone loses their phone, or it is stolen, the two questions that commonly arise are: how to locate the phone? And if it is not possible, how to remotely wipe the phone’s data? People can use the Android Device Manager (also referred to as "Find My Device") and do the exact two things. The best thing about this is that it doesn’t need to be installed as it is inbuilt on all Android Devices.

Let us look at the following steps to know how to reset Android phones to factory settings from the computer.

_**Requirements for Android Device Manager to Work:**_

• It must be activated in the Huawei Nova Y71 device administrator settings. Go to settings > Security > Device administrators and check whether ADM is enabled as a device administrator or not.  
• The location of the Huawei Nova Y71 device must be ON  
• The device must be signed in to a Google account  
• The device must have an active internet connection  
• The device should not be switched off  
• Even if the Huawei Nova Y71 device is without SIM, the Google account must be active

_**Steps to use ADM to wipe or locate any Android Device:**_

![go to find my](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/hard-reset-android-using-pc-1.jpg)

**Step 1:** Directly go to the [Android Device Manager website](https://www.google.com/android/find/), and log in to your account. You will get three options: "Play Sound", "Secure Device" and "Erase Device".

**Step 2:** Click on the "Play Sound" option will make it raise the alarm, notifying of the location, you can easily locate your Android phone if it is nearby.

**Step 3:** Click "Secure Device", you can remotely lock your device with a new passcode, display a custom message on the lock screen, and even track the Huawei Nova Y71 device's location in real-time. It also gives you the option to add a contact number, so anyone who finds your device can reach out to you.

**Step 4:** Select "Erase Device" to reset your device. Once you select this option, the interface will take over and complete the job. Congratulations! You have successfully used the Android Device Manager (ADM) to reset your Android smartphone.

## The Bottom Line

So these were the third different methods through which you can hard reset your Android device. Resetting the Huawei Nova Y71 device involves removing every data from the Huawei Nova Y71 device. The phone gets back to the same state as it was out of the box. Hence, most importantly, do not forget to back up data using Phone Backup and restore beforehand so that you do not end up losing anything important.
