**Step 3:** Choose Virtual Location and connect your phone.

![wondershare drfone virtual location module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Vivo X Fold 2 users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Vivo X Fold 2. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Vivo X Fold 2 app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

![drfone virtual location multi point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

## Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## How to Share Location in Messenger On Vivo X Fold 2?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

![facebook messenger live location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg)

What if you wish to send a particular address from another location? There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.

### How to Grant Facebook Messenger the Permission to Access Your Location?

Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing feature will not work without the necessary access. That’s why you should first configure the permission settings on your mobile device to avoid unwanted disruptions. Don’t worry. It’s indeed a piece of cake. Check out the tutorial provided below.

- **1:** Go to **Settings.**
- **Step 2:** Click **Apps.**

### Method 2: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Pinned Location

Let’s say there is a specific place you want to visit with your friend. Is there a way to share the address of the venue without you being there at the moment? Fortunately, it is possible. Apart from sharing your current location in real-time via Live Location, you can also send pinned locations on Messenger. You just need to search for it and then redirect the details to your friend. Yes. It’s just as simple as that. Do you want to try it on your smartphone? If so, follow the guide below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Facebook Messenger** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Scroll through your conversations and find the receiver from the list. Click on it.
- **Step 3:** On the text field, click the **More (+)** icon at the bottom-left corner.
- **Step 4:** Then, click **Location.**
- **Step 5:** Locate the search bar above the interactive map and type in the location you want to share.

- **Step 6:** Choose one from the suggested results and then click on it. The details will then be forwarded immediately to the intended receiver.

### Method 3: Share location on Facebook Messenger via Google Maps location

As a result, it doesn’t appear on the map when you try to search for it. But don’t sweat it. If you experience the same issue, you can instead use Google Maps to share location details. How to do it? Check out the tutorial provided below.

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Google Maps** application on your mobile device.
- **Step 2:** Click on the **Search** bar at the top and then type in the location.

- **Step 3:** Choose one from the suggestions and then tap on it. Make sure that it is exactly what you’re looking for.
