Further, if you enter the wrong password six times, then a message is displayed stating that the iPhone has been disabled.

![forgot-iphone-password-best-solutions](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1-2.jpg)_Figure 1. If you enter the wrong password six times in a row, then a message will be displayed stating that your iPhone has been disabled._

## Forgot iPhone passcode? What to do next?

Alright, I know it’s next to impossible that you will ever forget your passcode but we cannot overlook the fact that, yes there is a chance that you may forget it. The majority of us will say that we use fingerprint identity sensor (Touch ID) and hardly use a numeric passcode.

Unfortunately, you’ll only restore data that has been backed up and any new data added after that won’t be there. That said, let’s delve into some of the best solutions for forgotten iPhone password.  
If you’ve forgotten the password, these options will help you out:

- Erase your iOS device with iTunes to remove the password
- Erase the passcode with iCloud
- Use Recovery mode if you’re unable to connect to either iCloud or iTunes
- Leverage an iPhone data recovery to recover deleted/lost data
