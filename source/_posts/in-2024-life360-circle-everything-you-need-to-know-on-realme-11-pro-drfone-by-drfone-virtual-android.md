## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Realme 11 Pro

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

## Part 4: Fake GPS Location Spoofer User Reviews

To clarify the credibility of the **Fake GPS Location Spoofer app**, we also took our time to check what other users are saying.

Here, we've summarized some of the top reviews from real users on Playstore.

| **Platform** | **User** | **Remarks** | **Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _The company updates the app, in their own words, fixes the bug, and then expects you to pay again and again and again. Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with "routes' ' or "joystick" added. I wouldn't mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn't. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn't working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn't have import & export or a joystick. Import & export wouldn't be important if reliable._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | Douglas Buell | _This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the "no ads' ' mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I'm immediately shown an ad the instant I've clicked the message "Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!" Why include a feature that doesn't work? To force us to watch an ad you didn't have to work for? Ridiculous._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It's not difficult, but My Realme 11 Pro keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won't be using google maps, set it up there, and you're all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works._ | 4.0/5.0 |
