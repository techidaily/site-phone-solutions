Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an **Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G hard reset**. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.

### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don't like an update's new features and settings. Before your **Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G hard reset**, make sure to backup your data on cloud storage to restore it afterward.
