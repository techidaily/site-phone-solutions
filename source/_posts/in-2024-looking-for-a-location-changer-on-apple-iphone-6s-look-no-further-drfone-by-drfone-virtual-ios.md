- Firstly download the Dr. Fone Virtual Location app. Though the app's current version has an old interface, the functionality is cleared from any glitches. The latest interface will soon be available. Now click on the “Virtual Location” from the options and connect your Android/ iPhone to your computer, and hit “Get Started”.

- Now in the window, find your existing location on your map with the help of the “center on” icon, which is located on the right sidebar. You will go to your current location upon clicking.

- Now hit “teleport mode” at the top right. Enter your desired teleport located and hit the “Go” icon. Let's visit Rome for this example.
- You have successfully teleported to Rome. Click “Move Here”
- Now your location is fixed to Rome.

### How to add your route as a favorite

- On your virtual location screen, click on the five-star beside the route and add it to your favorite.
- Once you have added, hit the five-star icon again at the right-sidebar and locate the route you wish to use. Now hit the “Move” button and start walking along your favorite route again.

### How to simulate movement along the route using multi-spot

- Choose multi-spot mode at the top right corner.
- The left sidebar tells how far it will travel to reach the location. Now set the moving speed and specify the number of times to cycle between the locations. Now click “Start Moving”.
