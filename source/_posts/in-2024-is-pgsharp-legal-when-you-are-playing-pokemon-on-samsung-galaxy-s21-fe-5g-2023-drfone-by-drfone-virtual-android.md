## Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)?

Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.

![pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg)

Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of "catching them all."

'Spoofing' location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you're in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.

## **Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?**

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo's Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.

So, ****is PGSharp legal?**** No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.

 According to Niantic's terms and conditions:

- "Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device's location (for example through GPS spoofing).
- And _"_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software)."

 If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.

- The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.
- The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.
- The third strike will permanently ban your account.

 You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you've been banned without violation of any terms.

## ****Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android****

1. **PGSharp :**

![pgsharp-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg)

PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.

****Note:**** It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.

- To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google's "Play store," search "PGSharp," and install it.
- After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.
- For the paid key, visit PGSharp's official website and generate a license key.

You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an "out of stock." message.

- After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.

****Note:**** You may need to allow "Mock location" from debugging options. For this, go to "Settings," then to "About Phone," then you need to tap on "Build number" seven times to enable developer's mode, and finally go to "Debugging" to allow "Mock location."

2. ****Fake GPS Go:****

![fake gps go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg)

Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world. This is one of the easiest solutions to playing Pokémon   Go while spoofing location without getting detected with its real-map-like UI. Moreover, this app does not even require root access.

- To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google's "Play store," search "Fake GPS Go," and install it.
- Then, go to your phone's "Settings" and then "System" followed by "About Phone," and tap on the "Build Number" 7 times to enable the Developer Options.
- Then you need to go to "Debugging" in "Developers Options" to allow "Mock location."
- And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.

3. **VPN:**

![vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.

Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.

- To install a VPN, go to Google's "Play store," search the VPN of your choice and install it.
- Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.
- Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.

****Note:**** Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data. Hence, selecting a good VPN app is imperative, which will spoof GPS location and data encryption.

You can use both VPNs (which do not spoof GPS location themselves) and the Fake location app simultaneously for extra reliability.

## ****Part 3: Best way to spoof on iOS – dr.fone Virtual Location****

Spoofing the GPS location on iPhones is more difficult and much more complex than it is on Android. However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.

Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select "Virtual Location" given on the first page of the program.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select "Get Started". Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3: Enable the "teleport mode" by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone's GPS to in the text box in the map's left-upper section. Select "Go".

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4: Now select "Move here." And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

****Pro-Tips:****

- Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.
- Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.
- Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)
- After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.
- Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.
- Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.

Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who's on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.

## 8 Solutions to Fix 'Find My Friends Location Not Available' On Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)

There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don't stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working. Go through this guide, and you'll know what to do to take care of the problem.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)

### Tip 5: Enable Share My Location

Another tip to try out when your friend's location is not available is to make certain that you've enabled [Share My Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html) feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** For Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  users: get to the "Settings" app and go to "Privacy & Security". You will find the "Location Services" feature, click on it, and see the "Share My Location" feature.

![enable share my location](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg)

Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.

For Android users, go to "Settings" > "Additional settings" > "Privacy" > "Location", and choose the location mode to enable it.

### Tip 6: Restart the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  or Android Phones

The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)  X and 11/12/13/14, you'll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.

![restart Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) ](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) .jpg)

Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device to shut down. Wait for a minute before you restart the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device, and hopefully, the feature will start working again as usual.

### Tip 7: Check That Your Friend Has Signed into Find My Friends

Another tip that can help you resolve to **Find My Friends location not available** is checking that your friend has signed into the app. It is apparent that if your friend hasn't logged into the feature, you won't access his/her location.

Open the Find Friends app, log into it, and enable the location-sharing feature.

### Tip 8: Quit Find My Friends App and Open It Again

Last but not least valuable tip to use when the Find Friends location is not available is to quit the app. There is a possibility that you've faced the problem only because of a momentary issue or some random glitch. Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.

Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device from the account, and adding it again.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.

### Final Words

To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.
