![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** A map with the coordinates of the entire world will appear. On the top right corner of the page, click on the third icon - Teleport Mode. Now, choose the place that you want to virtually shift to.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The new Virtual Location will display on your iPhone Location Settings as well and Spotify update location will also be the same.

The process doesn’t take much of your time and you can change your location any number of times that you want. Not only on Spotify, your other social media apps and location using apps will also record the new virtual location.

**Cydia - Location Faker App**

For the Spotify Change Region, Cydia's Location Faker App is the perfect choice for iPhones. The software is also available in different versions to choose for your device model. You won’t need a computer for this and everything happens over your iPhone only.

**Step 1:** Download the Locationfaker version suitable for your phone. Locationfaker8 is available for the 8.0 version of iPhone.

![download locationfaker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-locationfaker-version-app-pic9.jpg)

**Step 2:** You will notice a map appear on the screen. You can either move your pin-point to the new location or enter the address or coordinates into the search box on top of the page.

![map toggle off and on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/toggle-off-and-on-pic10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you settle with the coordinates, shift the ‘Off’ toggle to ‘On’. It is present at the bottom of the page.

![change off toggle to on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-and-permit-apps-pic11.jpg)

**Step 4:** On the bottom of the page, in the same line as the toggle, you will find the ‘i’ icon. Click on that and several options will open. From there, choose ‘White List’. All the apps that need access to your new location will display. Search for Spotify and enable it.

**Cydia - Location Handle App**

To change spotify region, the Location Hanle App from Cydia might bring in more benefits than the usual location spoofing options. This is usually a very good choice for those people who play games and like to fool their friends with a fake location. However, for Spotify update Location, it still does a great job.

**Step 1:** You can download the Location Handle application either from their website or the app store. Wait till it completely installs.

![ydia location handle app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-location-handle-app-pic13.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, the map tab will appear along with an option to choose from 4 location changing types.

**Cydia - Location Handle App**

- Normal Mode - Change the location to anywhere
- Offset Mode - Change to a location that is only a few feet away.
- Automatic mode - Change to a new location slowly, as if you were walking.
- Manual Mode - change to a new location by using the joystick to navigate.

![choose mode for spoofing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/choose-the-mode-for-spoofing-pic14.jpg)

**Step 3:** Here, we are learning how to achieve Manual Spotify Change Region. So, go with the Manual Mode

![manual spotify change region](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-pic15.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now the map will appear on the page, more clearly with the pin and a search box for entering coordinates will also display. You can update Spotify location there.

![update location using shift handle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-shift-handle-pic16.jpg)

**Step 5:** The Joystick will show you the different directions and when you move it, your location on the map also changes. Settle on the one that best fits you and proceed.

## **Part 4: How to use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

The Virtual Private Network apps will change your server and your location and IP address will be masked completely. We suggest that you use NordVPN, that is quite easy to work with.

**Step 1:** Download NordVPN from the App Store or Google Play Store

![nordvpn app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic24.jpg)

**Step 2:** To change Location on Spotify, Sign Up and NordVPN will find the nearest server for you.

**Step 3:** If you do not prefer the server that they connected to you, disconnect from that server. You can update location on spotify using another server.

![change server using spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic26.jpg)

**Step 4:** Then go to ‘More Options’ > Servers > All countries and choose the country that you want. The same will reflect on Spotify too.
