Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Apple iPhone 15 Pro. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Apple iPhone 15 Pro app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:
