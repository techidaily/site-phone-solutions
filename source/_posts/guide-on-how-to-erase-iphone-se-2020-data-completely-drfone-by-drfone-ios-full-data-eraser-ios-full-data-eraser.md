## Guide on How To Erase iPhone SE (2020) Devices Entirely With Dr.Fone

Device data is ceremonially essential, leading to the need for protection from any unauthorized access. While selling out an iPhone, erasing data from the iPhone SE (2020) device is considered the most crucial clause. Although people consider manually erasing the device's data, it is not optimal. Thus, the need for a data eraser is appropriate. This guide comes with a comprehensive overview of how to use [Dr.Fone - Data Eraser (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/ios-data-eraser/) to erase iOS data entirely.

**Note:** Wondershare Dr.Fone for Mac has not had an updated interface; however, it does not affect the functionality of Dr.Fone. The interface will soon be updated on Mac.
