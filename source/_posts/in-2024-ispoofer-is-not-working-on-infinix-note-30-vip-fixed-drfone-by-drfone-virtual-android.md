## iSpoofer is not working On Infinix Note 30 VIP? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Infinix Note 30 VIP device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)

If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use [Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) Changer. WIthin 3-4 steps you can easily change your location to anywhere in the world. This is how you do it -

## What are Location Permissions Life360 On Infinix Note 30 VIP?

Sometimes you need to decide whether you can share certain personal information or data about yourself with others, which may involve location permissions.

Location permissions Life360 allows you to share the location of your device with other apps, even if those apps aren't in your app library. It's usually a good idea to use location permissions sparingly, but sometimes you'll need to use them.

Life360 uses location permissions for a few different reasons. For example, Life360 uses location permissions to show nearby friends when they check in to places so that you can see who is nearby and what they're up to.

## Part 1：What Does "Location Permissions Off" Mean on Life360?

There are two ways to prevent GPS tracking on the phone: switch off the phone's GPS or take off Life360 rights to track your whereabouts using GPS.

It's possible that Life360 won't work properly if you don't accept the permissions it requests during the installation process. When it comes to authorizing access to Life360, you have the following choices available to you:

If you choose the 'never option', the application will not be granted the required rights. As a result, the software may fail to perform as it is meant to. Whether you're unclear if you want to offer the program complete access or not, this is the ideal 'Ask any time' decision to bring.

Your location may be granted every time the app is used if you wish. 'While the App' setting permits accessibility to Location Services only when the app itself or one of its functionalities is currently displayed on the screen.

Your device's status bar may glow blue and display a message notifying you that an application is currently using your location data if the While Using the App setting is enabled for one of your apps.

"Always" grants the software all the permissions it needs. So, for example, allowing location permission will be done – every time the app launches. As a result, the software can track your location even if the application is closed.

## Part 2：Can My Infinix Note 30 VIP Be Tracked If Location Services Are Off?

If you misplace your phone or want to run an application that requires to access your location, you may use the already developed location settings on your smartphone. Suppose, on the other hand; you don't want anybody to track your phone?

Is it possible to track a phone even if the location services are disabled? Mobile phones can be tracked even when location services are off, and the answer to that question is, "Yes."

Disabling your phone's location services might help you hide your current whereabouts. This is critical if you don't want others to be able to follow your movements or activities. However, other methods may still find a smartphone's overall geolocation using different ways.

### 1\. Cell-Site Simulators

A cell-site simulator is a device that can imitate a mobile phone tower and force a nearby mobile phone to connect to it. Cell site simulators can be purchased online or at a local electronics store. Law enforcement agencies use them to locate a phone without a warrant.

### 2\. Malware or Spyware

Malware and spyware can use various techniques to track your phone's location. For example, a malware program may be able to detect your location based on Your Infinix Note 30 VIP's hardware.

Some mobile malware or spyware can detect and track your location without the need for the user's consent.

### 3\. Cell Towers

Cell towers can provide a rough estimate of a phone's location. A cell tower is a network access point that connects a mobile phone to the Internet. A smartphone's location can be found by triangulating the position of cell towers near your device. This method works best when the cell towers are close together.

### 4\. Wi-Fi Snooping

When a Wi-Fi hotspot is nearby, your phone can connect to it without needing to connect to a cell tower. Your phone can then transmit the signal back to the hotspot, which will record the Infinix Note 30 VIP device's IP address.

## Part 3：How Do I Pause Life360 without My Parents Knowing?

There are many ways to ensure your parents do not know where you are and what you are doing. Some of these methods are:

### 1\. Switch to the Airplane Mode

Turning on Airplane Mode on your smartphone is another fast approach to preventing Life360 from broadcasting your whereabouts without your parents being aware. Unfortunately, you'll be unable to use your phone's internet connection after setting off Airplane Mode, so you'll lose your GPS position.

![switch to the airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/what-are-location-permissions-life360-1.jpg)

![turn off circle's location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/what-are-location-permissions-life360-2.jpg)

![stop using the gps on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/what-are-location-permissions-life360-4.jpg)

### 4\. Take use of a Burner Phone
