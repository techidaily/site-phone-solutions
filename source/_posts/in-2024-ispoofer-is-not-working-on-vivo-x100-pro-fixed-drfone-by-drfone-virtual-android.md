## iSpoofer is not working On Vivo X100 Pro? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Vivo X100 Pro device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)

If you are looking for a sure shot at changing your location without any hassle, then the best suggestion would be to use [Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) Changer. WIthin 3-4 steps you can easily change your location to anywhere in the world. This is how you do it -

## Can Life360 Track You When Your Vivo X100 Pro is off?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Did you know that your Vivo X100 Pro tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your Vivo X100 Pro can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your Vivo X100 Pro, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Vivo X100 Pro is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

- [Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part1)
- [Part 2: Does life360 work if the phone is off?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part2)
- [Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part3)

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Vivo X100 Pro and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Vivo X100 Pro and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

## Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life. An issue with your Internet connection will come up instead of location stopped in this situation. So don't connect to any Wi-Fi at all.

### 2\. Fake Locations

Using location spoofing applications on an Android smartphone, your kids can fool you into thinking they're somewhere else. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location spoofing application that will trick you into thinking that you are in a different location than you really are. The GPS position of the Vivo X100 Pro device will be updated to reflect the new place that you have chosen thanks to the software. It is worth noting that Dr. Fone - Virtual Location for iOS may also enable you to imitate GPS movement.

It has several other noticeable features that can help you in your daily life.

![access virtual location feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Conclusion

Can you track a phone if the location is off? Life360 has become a standard feature of many smartphones. Parents often use it to monitor their children's location. The fact that Life360 can be used to track users is quite disturbing. The good news is that there are ways to stop Life360 from tracking you. The best and all-in-one solution is a third-party application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/drfone-toolkit.html).
