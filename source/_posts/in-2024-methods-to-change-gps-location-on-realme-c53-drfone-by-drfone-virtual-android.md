The application will never go to waste, won't occupy much of your computer/PC/Laptop's space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.



## Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme C53 using External Device

You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme C53 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone's geographic location.

The best external device to change phone location Realme C53 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -

**Step 1**: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone's port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme C53 device to your iPhone.

![double location dongle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg)

Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location's official website.

![companion app double location map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg)

**Step 3**: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.

## Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C53 using XCode

This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme C53 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme C53 stays connected to it.

**Step 1**: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.

![download xcode app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg)

**Step 2**: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the 'Single View Application' to start a new Project and go on by clicking on 'Next'. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.

![identify yourself](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg)

**Step 4**: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config --global user.email "[<u>you@example.com</u>](mailto:you@example.com)" and git config --global user. name "your name".You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.

![iphone connects to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg)

**Step 6**: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the 'Build Device' option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme C53 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.

![process-detection-on-iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg)

**Step 7**: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu > Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme C53 as well.

**Step 2**: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from 'OFF' to 'ON' at the bottom of the page.

![cydia toggle shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg)

This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone's location.

## Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme C53 using Location Handle

Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store

![location handler cydia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg)

**Step 2**: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.

![teleport-coordination](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg)

**Step 3**: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.

![manual mode location handle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg)

**Step 4**: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.

![chowchilla location handler](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg)
