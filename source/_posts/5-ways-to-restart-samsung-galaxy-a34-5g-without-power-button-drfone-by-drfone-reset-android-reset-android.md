**Step 5**: Dr. Fone only takes a few minutes to erase all data from your Android phone. Keep the phone connected, and don't open any phone management software.

**Step 6**: You will be asked to tap Factory Data Reset or Erase All Data after all app data, photos, and other private data have been completely erased. There will be a complete wipe of your phone.

These are all methods for unlocking Samsung Galaxy A34 5G hard reset. It is possible to apply each technique if you have forgotten the password of your Samsung Galaxy A34 5G . You should use Dr.Fone - Phone Backup and Data Eraser to prevent data loss. It is possible, however, to try another method until you have unlocked your phone completely if one fails.
