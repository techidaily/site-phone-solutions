**Step 4**: Ensure all the necessary data is backed up before proceeding since all the erased data will not be recoverable. Confirm your operation by typing "000000".

**Step 5**: Dr. Fone only takes a few minutes to erase all data from your Android phone. Keep the phone connected, and don't open any phone management software.
