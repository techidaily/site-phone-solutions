Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.
