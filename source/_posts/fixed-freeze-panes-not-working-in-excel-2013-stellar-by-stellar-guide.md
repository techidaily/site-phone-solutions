## File Format and Extension of \[filename\] don't Match in Excel File

**Summary:** The “File format and extension of \[filename\] don't match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe” error message indicates that the Excel file you’re trying to open is unsupported, unsafe, or corrupted. Read this article to learn more about this error and how to fix this error. It also mentions an advanced Excel recovery tool to repair the corrupted Excel file and retrieve all its data in a few clicks.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

You can encounter the **“File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe”** error when the Excel application detects any issue with the file. This happens when you try to open an old version file format in a newer version or if the file is received from an unsafe destination. This can prevent you from opening the Excel file.

**As indicated from the error message, this error occurs due to the following reasons:**

- The file has incorrect file extension.
- The file is corrupted.
- The file you are trying to open is protected.

Now, let’s see how to resolve this Excel error.

## **Methods to Fix the “File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match” Error**

Try the following methods to troubleshoot the “File format and extension don’t match” error in Excel.

### **Method 1: Rename the Excel File**

You can face the “File format and extension don’t match” issue if the file has incorrect extension. It can occur if the file extension has been altered or you’ve mistakenly saved the file with incorrect extension. To fix this, you can try renaming the Excel file with the correct file extension.  

### **Method 2: Check the Default Excel File Format**

Different versions of Microsoft Excel use different default file formats. For example, .xls is the default file format of older versions (2003 and lower) of Excel, whereas .xlsx format is used by the newer versions (2007 and later). Opening the Excel file with an incompatible extension can cause the “File format and extension don’t match” issue. You can check the Excel version you are using and ensure it’s compatible with the Excel file you are trying to open.

### **Method 3: Change the Protected View Settings**

You may receive the “**File format and extension of excel don’t match**” error if the Excel file is protected. You can check and try disabling the [Protected View settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653).  

**Caution:** Changing the Protected View settings can put your system at risk. If the Excel file is being downloaded from the internet, it may contain viruses that can infect your system. So be careful before disabling the Protected View settings.

### **Steps to Change Protected View Settings in Excel:**

- In the Excel’s File menu, click on **Options.**
- Select **Trust Center > Trust Center Settings**.

![Go to Trust Center and then click Trust center settings.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-trust-center-and-then-trust-center-settings.jpg)

- Under **Trust Center**, select **Protected View** and disable the below three options:

- Click **OK.** Then, try to open the Excel file.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide the Excel File Permissions**

Sometimes, you can get the error if you don’t have sufficient permissions to open the Excel file. This usually happens when you try to open the Excel file received from other sources. You can check and provide the desired permissions to fix the error. Here are the steps:

- Locate the affected Excel file, right-click on it, and select **Properties.**

![Illustrates the 'Read-only' attribute in Excel XLSX document](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/read-only-properties-2.jpg)

Now try to open the Excel document and check if the problem is fixed.

- **Adjust Antivirus Settings**

A few antivirus programs block Excel files and other Office documents by opening those in 'read-only' mode. In such cases, try adjusting the antivirus settings to open the Excel files normally. This will allow you to edit, modify, and save the Excel workbook without encountering the “Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be a read-only or encrypted” error message.

- **Disable Protected-View**

The error may appear when you try to open an Excel file received as email attachments or downloaded from unsafe source. The file may potentially contain viruses, worms, or other types of malware that could damage the system or the server.

To safeguard the system, MS Excel opens such files in **Protected View**. It may also open an Excel workbook in Protected Mode when it detects a problem with the file. This security feature allows you to read or view Excel files and reduces the risks to the computer system or PC.

However, you can click **File > Info** and then click '**Edit Anyway**' to access and edit file content. You may also disable the **Protected View** setting via **_File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings…> Protected View._** However, we do not recommend this.

- **Renew/Activate Microsoft Office**

If MS Office is in a deactivated state or its subscription has expired, the Office documents, including the Excel, could be in 'read-only reduced functionality mode.'

In such a scenario, activate Microsoft Office or renew the Office subscription. Then open the Excel workbook and check if the problem of 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' is resolved.

- **Check if OneDrive Storage is Full**

If Excel files are saved on OneDrive with low or no storage space, you may encounter such issues with your files.

To know the amount of free space on OneDrive, follow these steps:

- On your PC, open **Settings** and navigate to OneDrive.
  - Click '**Sync Settings > File Storage**' to see available space.

You may also visit onedrive.live.com, sign in to the account, and then check the available space. If there's no space available or the drive is full, empty the storage space and see if the problem is resolved.

- **Check and Update MS Office and Windows**

Microsoft releases updates to fix known errors. Thus, it is critical to update both Windows and MS Office to the latest release and avoid issues, such as 'Excel cannot access 'xxx.xls.' The Document may be read-only or encrypted.'

- **Repair MS Office (MS Excel)**

The error 'Excel cannot open read-only documents' may appear due to a problem with your MS Office (MS Excel) program. You can repair the MS Office program to resolve such errors. The steps are as follows:

- Open Control Panel and click **Uninstall a Program** link under **Programs.**
- Choose Microsoft Office from the list and click the **Change** button.

![Change button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/repair-ms-office-4.png)

- Select Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems with MS Office and MS Excel. It will also restore any missing or damaged program files.

![Quick Repair and then click Repair to fix problems](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/quick-repair-ms-office-5.png)

After the Repair, open the Excel workbook and check if the error is resolved.

- **Check Permissions**

The error message may also appear if you access an Excel workbook from a network or shared drive due to lack of write permission. Make sure you have read and write permissions assigned for the particular network drive. Alternatively, you can copy the file from the network drive and save it in your local folder to access and edit it without encountering this error message.

- **Repair MS Excel File**

If none of the solutions worked, the Excel workbook could be damaged or corrupt. To repair such damaged Excel workbook or spreadsheet, you can use the inbuilt '**Open and Repair…**’ option in MS Excel or install an **[Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)**, such as Stellar Repair for Excel.
