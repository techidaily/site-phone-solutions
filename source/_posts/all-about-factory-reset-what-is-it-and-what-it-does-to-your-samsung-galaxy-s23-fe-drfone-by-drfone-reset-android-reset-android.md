Do you want to hard reset your Samsung Galaxy S23 FE phone? When your phone is not showing its peak performance, it can be very annoying because its working gets slower. If your phone is lagging and apps are not working properly, then there is a problem with its software. The only way to fix this problem is with a hard reset that will restore factory settings in your phone. You can do it to fix your phone or to remove all data if you want to sell it.

We will give you simple step-by-step tutorials for each method. Although the procedure is simple, it is best to follow each step.

## Using Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Hard Reset in What Situations?

### 1: Erase All Data and Settings

One of the most common reasons for a hard reset is to erase all data and settings from the phone. When your phone runs out of storage, you can only delete the previous data if you want to save something new. Although Samsung Galaxy S23 FE phones provide a lot of storage and support SD cards, you can only erase unwanted data if you run out of space. Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an **Samsung Galaxy S23 FE hard reset**. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.

### 2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps

If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn't work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don't like an update's new features and settings. Before your **Samsung Galaxy S23 FE hard reset**, make sure to backup your data on cloud storage to restore it afterward.

In another scenario, let's say your phone is stolen or you lost it. All you need to do is use the **Samsung Galaxy S23 FE hard reset** to ensure no one can access your personal data.

- Open settings and tap on the “system” option.
- Tap on the “Reset Options” in the system menu.
- Tap on Erase all data or factory reset.
- Enter the Password and tap reset for confirmation.
- The system will erase all data and reboot.

### 2: Restore with Recovery Mode

Suppose you want to hard reset your locked Samsung Galaxy S23 FE phone, use the recovery mode. With recovery mode, you don't have to go to settings and erase data after providing the password. The only drawback of using recovery mode is that it is not best for beginners. Follow these steps for your **Samsung Galaxy S23 FE hard reset** using recovery mode.

- Power off your mobile phone.
- Hold the volume up and power buttons.
- Enter the menu and navigate using the volume up and down buttons.
