![wipe data factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925871266656.jpg)

Since Wipe data/factory reset deletes all applications, app data, and information (documents, videos, images, music, etc) stored in the internal space, it is required for you to perform a [data backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) operation before you reset the Android device to factory settings. However, wipe data/factory reset does not affect the SD card in any way.

## Part 2: How to perform Wipe Data/ Factory Reset?

Performing [wipe data/factory reset on your Android device](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)e is very simple.
