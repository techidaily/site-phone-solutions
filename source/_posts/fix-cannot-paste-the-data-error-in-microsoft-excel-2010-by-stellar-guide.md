## Fix Cannot Paste the Data Error in Microsoft Excel

When copying and pasting the cell contents or attributes from one workbook to another, you can encounter the "Cannot paste the data" error. The error indicates that the values you are trying to paste do not match the cell format (Currency, Date, Text, etc.) used in the column. The error can occur if you are attempting to paste information into a merged cell. You can also get this error if the data you are trying to paste contains more columns than the destination worksheet can accept or if the copy area and paste area aren't the same size.

## Why you cannot Paste the Data in Microsoft Excel?

You can experience the "Excel cannot paste the data" error due to one of the following reasons:

- Locked cells
- Data size limitation
- Formatting issues
- The file size is too large
- Overloaded clipboard
- Data type mismatch
- Invalid range
- Lack of permissions
- Excel file is corrupted
- Compatibility issues
- While pasting the merged cells

## **Methods to Fix MS Excel Cannot Paste the Data Error**

The "Microsoft Excel cannot paste the data" error usually appears when copying and pasting data within the spreadsheet. It primarily affects the copy-and-paste feature within the Excel file. However, the impact of this error may vary with the data you are working with. When this error occurs, first try restarting the Excel application. Ensure that you've saved all your important data before restarting the application to prevent data loss. If, after performing this basic step, you still face the issue, then try the following troubleshooting methods.

### **Method 1: Check and Unlock Cells in Excel**

You can get the Excel cannot paste the data error if the cells you are trying to paste in the Excel file are locked. You can check and unlock the specific cells in the Excel file using the below steps:

- Go to the **Home** tab in your Excel file and click **Format Cell Font** popup launcher.

![Selecting Protection from Font family with formatting](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-protection-in-format-cells.jpg)

### **Method 2: Check and Fix the Cell Format**

Sometimes, you can get the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel if there is an issue with the formatting of the cells in the column (in which you are trying to paste the data). You can check whether the cell formats of the columns of the source file (from where you are copying data) match the destination file (in which you are pasting the cell data). If not, then change the cell format. Here's how to do so:

- In the Excel file, click on the affected column heading (whose cells you need to modify).
- Navigate to the **Home** tab and click the **General** dropdown menu.

**![Navigate to Home and Click general drop down menu in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/cannotpastedata/click-general-dropdown-menu.jpg)**

- Click on the desired cell format that matches the values you are trying to paste into the column.

### **Method 3: Check Copy and Paste Area Size**

The "data cannot be pasted" issue can also occur if Excel detects the copy area of the range of cells is not of the same size and shape as that of the paste area. So, make sure the size of the range of cells for the paste area is same as the copied area. To ensure this, you can try the following:

- **Use Upper-left Cell**

 You can select the upper-left cell instead of the complete range to paste.

- **Use Paste Special Option**

- You can use the **Paste Special** option to paste the data. To use this option, go to **Home > Paste Special**.

- You can choose from the different options, such as paste all, formulas, operations, Transpose, skip blanks, etc. to take control over how the data is pasted.

### **Method 4:** Check and Unmerge Cells

The merged cells in the workbook can create discrepancies when copying and pasting data. These can create mismatch between the source and destination cell areas, resulting in errors. Make sure you are not pasting the data copied from merged cells. You can check and unmerge the cells using the below steps:

- Open the Excel file (in which you are copying data) and go to the Home tab.
- Click Merge & Center > Unmerge Cells.

### **Method 5: Unselect the Excel DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) Option**

Sometimes, you can get the Excel cannot paste the data error while copying and pasting data from Excel file to external data sources or applications. It usually appears if you have established DDE links between them. To resolve this, you can uncheck the "Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)" option. Follow the below steps to do so:

- Open your Excel file.
- Go to **File > Options**.

In **Excel Options**, click **Advanced** and unselect **"Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**. Click **OK.**

## Here are some additional solutions you can try to fix the "Cannot paste the data" error in Excel

### **Check the Excel File Format**

Sometimes, the copy and paste error can occur if you try to move data from an older version of Excel file (XLS) into a newer version file (XLSX) or vice versa. You can try to change or convert the file format to resolve the issue.

### **Clear Clipboard**

Too many items on the clipboard can prevent you from copying and pasting the data. You can [empty your clipboard](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/clear-the-clipboard-7afbf55f-d7d5-4096-87a0-eb17f821d321) by deleting all clips. To do this, go to **Home** and click the **Clipboard** option.

### **Change the Column's Cell Format**

You can get the "Cannot paste the data" error when the information you need to paste does not match the cell format in the column. In such a case, you can change the column's cell format. To do this, navigate to the **Home** option and then click on the **General menu** arrow. Then, change the cell format suitable to the type of information you are trying to paste in that column.

### **Add Columns**

The copy-and-paste error in Excel can also occur if there are not enough columns to accept the data that you are trying to paste. You can insert more columns and then try copying and pasting data. To insert additional columns, click on the column heading, click **Home**, and then select **Insert.**

### **Remove Incompatible Add-ins**

Sometimes, incompatible or faulty add-ins can also create conflicts with Excel's clipboard operations, leading to the error. To check if add-ins are causing the issue, open the Excel file in safe mode. In safe mode, if you are able to paste the data, then check and uninstall the incompatible Excel Add-ins.

## **What to do if Nothing Works?**

If the above methods do not work, then corruption in the Excel file could be the cause of the "Cannot paste the data" error. In such a case, you can use Excel's built-in Open and Repair utility to repair the corrupted file. Here's how to use this utility to repair the Excel file:

- Open your Excel application.
- Navigate to **File** and then click **Open.**
- Click the **Browse** option to select the affected Excel file.
- The **Open** dialog box opens up. Click on the corrupted file.
- From the **Open** dropdown, select the **Open and Repair** option.
- The Excel will prompt you to choose one of the below options:
- Repair
- Extract
- Cancel
- Select the **Repair** option to extract maximum data from the file. If the Repair option fails, choose the **Extract** option to recover the data, excluding formulas and values.

 The [Open and Repair utility may not be able to repair your Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) if it is severely corrupted.
