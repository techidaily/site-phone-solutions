## Part 3. How to Reset Itel P55+ Phone at Normal Cases?

In normal situations, the Itel P55+ phones can be reset using the settings menu or the Android Factory Reset code. Both these methods and their guide to getting the process done are listed below.

### Method 1: Reset Itel P55+ phones through the Phone Settings menu

To unlock the screen and reset your Itel P55+ phone, the settings menu of the Itel P55+ device can be used. For this method, you do not need to make your device enter the recovery mode. The steps for the process are as follows.

- **Step 1.** On your Itel P55+ phone, open the Settings app and look for the **Backup and Reset** option from the **Personalization** section.
- **Step 2.** Next, select **Factory Data Reset** Option.
- **Step 3.** Go through the on-screen details and then click on the **Reset device** button.

The steps above will reset your phone to the default factory settings.

### Method 2: Reset Itel P55+ phones with factory reset code

There are Android Reset Codes for different brands of phones that can be used for resetting the Itel P55+ device. These secret codes can be different phones as well as OS versions. In general, the code used for resetting Itel P55+ phones is **\*#\*#2846579#\*#\***.

Steps to reset Itel P55+ phone using secret reset code

- **Step 1.** On your Itel P55+ phone, go to the dialer and type the code- **\*#\*#2846579#\*#\***.
- **Step 2.** From the menu, click on the **Restore Factory** option.
- **Step 3.** Finally, to confirm the resetting of the Itel P55+ device, click on the **OK** button.

The above methods can also be tried if you get stuck in a situation on how to factory reset Itel P55+ tablets without password. Also, we recently covered a method of how to bypass the Google account on Itel P55+ after a factory reset, we have now had the opportunity to test this with many people with different models of Android and have found mixed results.

## Conclusion

The above given are multiple options that can be used for resetting your Itel P55+ phone when you forget your device unlock password. Some of these solutions can be used for free and if they work, nothing like that. [Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is one of the best methods to reset your Itel P55+ device as it supports removing all types of screen locks in a hassle-free manner.
