      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi K70, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi K70 cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi K70 would be a workable solution.

    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Xiaomi Redmi K70 and it failed terribly. Does Xiaomi Redmi K70 come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Xiaomi Redmi K70 on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
