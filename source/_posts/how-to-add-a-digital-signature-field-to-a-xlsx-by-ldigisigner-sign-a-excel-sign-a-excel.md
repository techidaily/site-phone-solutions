## 3. The Usage of Electronic Signature in Excel

The ability to leave your signature in electronic format in Excel documents opens up great opportunities for state institutions and for private enterprises and companies. Electronic signature technologies of documents allow:

- close deals and contracts remotely, without a personal meeting
- store documents in electronic form
- work with any devices, even while on the road
- to certify and establish requisites without the organization of business meetings

Now you don’t even need to be in the office to be able to verify the document. Considering that representatives of many professions increasingly prefer working remotely, and entrepreneurs cannot always be at the office, this is a convenient option with full legal force.

You only need a device - a laptop, tablet or smartphone, as well as access to the Internet. For work, the software is needed to be connected to the encrypted information with the document you are working on. Comparison of this information allows the partner to make sure that it was you who signed it. All these processes are performed automatically according to modern encryption standards.

## 4. How to Create Electronic Signature in Excel on Windows

You can use the standard features of Microsoft Office Excel to digitally sign a document. There are several options:

- create and insert handwritten signature in scan form
- create a template with text preparation
- Insert a signature line and fill it right in the document

To implement each of the ways to install a digital signature in Excel, you need to do a few steps.

### 4.1. Handwritten signature

Sign on a blank sheet of paper. Scan it and save the image in JPG or PNG format. In the standard image viewer, open the scanned signature and cut to remove the entire blank area of ​​the sheet. Save the changes. In the Excel document, click "Insert" - "Picture" and select the desired file on the device.

### 4.2. Text template

If you want your signature to complete information about the position, phone number, address, date or other data, create a text template in Excel on Windows.

Type in the document all the necessary information that should supplement the details, and select the mouse. In the "Insert" section, select "Express blocks" - "AutoText" and click on the "Save selected object" button.

To insert this block in other documents, just click on "Express Blocks" - "AutoText" and select the saved template to insert.

### 4.3. Excel signature line

You can also use a signature line in Excel to insert a signature with properties. To add it to your document, click "Insert" - "Signature string". After that, a field will appear in which you need to enter the position, name, address and a signature. Fill out all the fields, click OK.

A digital certificate is required for signing. Excel offers to get it from your partners, you can also order an individual digital certificate in the appropriate institution.

## 5. How to sign a document in Excel on Mac

To put an electronic signature in Excel on Mac, you must follow these steps:

- launch the "View" application
- go to "Tools"
- click "Add a note"
- go to "Signature" - "Manage signatures"

You can create a signature in two ways: by camera and trackpad. Sign on a sheet of paper and scan through iSight - no additional equipment will be required. In the same menu, managing signatures, you can sign with the help of the trackpad. Mouse to do this will not work, ideally, it is better to use the stylus.

Now open the document you want to sign on Mac, go to "Tools" - "Add mark" - "Signature". Click on the top panel on the icon that depicts a handwritten stroke, and you will see the previously saved signature. Select it to add to the document. Adjust the size of the signature by pulling on one of the corners, drag it to the desired part of the document. After that it can be closed, the changes are saved automatically.
