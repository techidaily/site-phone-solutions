## Part 2: Urgent FAQ about Fake Location on Hulu

### Q1. How to Fix a VPN Not Working with Hulu?

At times, even after connecting with a VPN, it may not work with Hulu and the user might get a message saying “you appear to be using an anonymous proxy tool”. The easiest and the simplest solution to this problem is by disconnecting from the present server and trying with a new one.

You can also clear the cache on your system and restart to again try connecting Hulu with

VPN. Some of the other solutions that might work include taking the help of the VPN support team, checking for IP and DNS leaks, disabling IPv6, or using a different VPN protocol.

### Q2. How to Bypass Hulu Error Codes?

While connecting Hulu using a VPN, you may encounter several errors like errors 16, 400, 406, and others with each of them having different issues like connection, account, server, and more. Depending on the type of type and meaning of the error, you can try bypassing and fixing it.

For Hulu errors 3 and 5 that are regarding connection issues, you can try to restart the streaming device and also restart your router. For error 16 that shows invalid region issues, you need to use a VPN that can help you bypass the region blocks of Hulu. Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the Itel A60s device from the account, and adding it again.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the Itel A60s devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

![home location error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/home-location-error.jpg)

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.

### Final Words

To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Thinking About Changing Your Netflix Region Without a VPN On Itel A60s?

Netflix is easily one of the most popular streaming apps available today. It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.

The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you're interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.

![change region without vpn netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg)

## Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions

Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.

Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix's Terms of Use. If you're caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant's Terms of Use.

## Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?

If you're wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don't”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you're connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.

## Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?

There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you're on your computer, iPhone, or Android. You can use a smart DNS service, a Proxy Server, or a [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to connect to a country you want to access. Follow our guide below to change country on Netflix now without a VPN.

### Method 1: Using a Smart DNS

Utilizing Smart DNS to change country on Netflix without VPN actually works in the same way. This is because Smart DNS re-routes your connection through a server in a different country. Keep in mind that Smart DNS is still a service and will require a subscription from a Smart DNS provider.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different online DNS providers. In this example, you'll see using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Register your IP address on your selected provider and obtain the appropriate DNS Server Address on your account.

![change dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: Open **Networking** settings on your computer, iPhone, PlayStation, or Xbox and find **DNS Settings** (the image below is an example for the Windows system).

![change dns server wifi properties](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-dns-server-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address. Click **Ok** once done and restart your computer. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**Pros**

- DNS servers are faster than a usual internet connection, so you can enjoy streaming at high connection speeds.
- DNS Servers don't encrypt your traffic or hide your IP address.

**Cons**

- DNS doesn't carry your information, as the server side will only see the IP address where the query came from, which hackers can manipulate.

### Method 2: Using a Proxy Server

Proxy Servers work the same as VPNs as it routes traffic to a third-party server. However, like DNS, Proxy Servers don't encrypt data but can mask your IP address. Here are the steps to watch NetFlix with a Proxy Server.

**Step 1**: Search for **Proxy Settings** on your computer.

![change proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-1.jpg)

**Step 2**: Choose between **Automatic** or **Manual proxy setup**.

**Step 3A**: For **Automatic proxy setup**, turn on **Automatically detect settings** and **Use setup script.** Afterward, enter the **Script address** and click **Save.**

![automatic proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-2.jpg)

**Step 3B**: For **Manual proxy setup,** click **Use a proxy server**. Input **Address** and **Port** numbers. Click **Save** afterward.

![manual proxy settings for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-proxy-netflix-3.jpg)

**Note**

To change Proxy on mobile phones, change your phone's proxy settings. Your Netflix app will automatically copy your phone's proxy settings if done correctly.

**Pros**

- Proxy Servers mask your IP address retaining anonymity.
- Proxies improve web browsing performance, especially when downloading large files.

**Cons**

- Proxy Servers don't encrypt data.

### Method 3: Using a [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

For the unfamiliar, Tor is an open-source network that encrypts your connection while stopping trackers from following your activity. Here are the steps to start using Tor Browser to watch Netflix without a VPN.

**Step 1**: Download and install [**Tor Browser**](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

![tor browser for netflix](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/tor-browser.jpg)

**Step 2**: Launch **Tor Browser** and click **Connect**.

**Step 3**: Go to **Netflix.com** and log in to your account.

**Note**

Tor Browser is available across all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

**Pros**

- Tor is completely free to use.
- Your browsing history automatically gets deleted.

**Cons**

- You can't control the region you have access to, so your Netflix content is not guaranteed to have what you're looking for.

### Conclusion

Changing your Netflix region with or without a VPN certainly has its perks. This is because you can watch your favorite series unavailable to your country to maximize your streaming access. Choosing a country with a lower subscription price also saves you money.

While it's not illegal to change your Netflix region, it does violate the streaming giant's Terms of Use. You should always research and know the pros and cons when circumventing Netflix's terms so your account doesn't get suspended or terminated.
