The phone gets back to the same state as it was out of the box. Hence, most importantly, do not forget to back up data using Phone Backup and restore beforehand so that you do not end up losing anything important.

## All Things You Need to Know about Wipe Data/Factoy Reset For Itel S23


Wiping data or carrying out a factory reset on an Android device is an effective solution for various issues on your Android phone. Even if you are contemplating selling your phone and you need all your device data to be wiped out, you carry out a factory reset. But, before you proceed, what’s important is to understand about wipe data/ factory reset, because, if you don’t, you might end up losing all your important data before it is backed up, serving no purpose. So, before you wipe data/ factory reset Android, here’s what you should know about it.

## Part 1: What data will be wiped by Wipe Data/Factory Reset?

Doing a factory reset on the Android device will remove all the applications installed on the Itel S23 device along with the data associated with them. This brings back all the default settings of the Itel S23 device as it was when the phone was new, giving you a clean slate to start all over again.

![wipe data factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925871266656.jpg)

Since Wipe data/factory reset deletes all applications, app data, and information (documents, videos, images, music, etc) stored in the internal space, it is required for you to perform a [data backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) operation before you reset the Android device to factory settings. However, wipe data/factory reset does not affect the SD card in any way. So, even if you have the SD card inserted with videos, images, documents, and any other personal information in the Android device while carrying out a factory reset, everything will remain safe and intact.

## Part 2: How to perform Wipe Data/ Factory Reset?

Performing [wipe data/factory reset on your Android device](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)e is very simple. It is a matter of time before you wipe out everything lying on the internal storage of your Android device. Here’s how you can perform Wipe data/ Factory Rest on your device:

Step 1: First of all, turn off the Itel S23 device. Then, use the volume up button, volume down button, and Power button on your Android device simultaneously and hold on to the buttons until the phone turns on.

![boot in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925873397589.jpg)

Step 2: Release the buttons when the Itel S23 device is powered on. Now, use the volume up and down button to sift through the options given on the screen. Use the power button to select “Recovery Mode” on the screen. Your phone will restart into “Recovery Mode’ and you will find the below screen:

Step 3: Holding the power button down, use the volume up button, and the Android system recovery menu will pop up.

![recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925873903261.jpg)

Now, scroll down to “wipe data/factory reset” option from the list of commands and use the Power button to select it.

Now, scroll down to “Yes – delete all user data” using the volume button and then push the power button to select.

![delete all user data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925874254055.jpg)

In some time your device will be reset into factory settings with all your data erased. The entire process will take a few minutes. Ensure that you have the phone at least 70% charged so that it does not run out of charge midway.

## Part 3: Does Wipe Data/ Factory Reset wipe all your data?

There are various instances where you would require performing a wipe/factory reset on your device. It might be because of some glitch that you would like to troubleshoot on your Android device. Wiping data from the phone is a universal solution in such cases. Even in cases where you want to sell your device, performing a factory reset seems the best option. What’s important is to make sure you don’t leave a trace of your personal information on the Itel S23 device. Therefore, wipe data/factory reset is never the ultimate solution to rely on. It is neither the best option anyway.

Contrary to conventional thought of relying on wipe data/factory reset Android believing it to be the best solution for wiping out complete data from the phone, all research outcomes have proved something different. It is easier to recover account tokens used to authenticate you when you enter a password for the first time, from service providers like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Google. Hence it is easier to restore the user’s credentials as well.

So, to protect your privacy and completely wipe data off the Itel S23 device, you can use Dr.Fone - Data Eraser. This is an amazing tool that erases everything on the Itel S23 device without leaving an ounce of data in it.
