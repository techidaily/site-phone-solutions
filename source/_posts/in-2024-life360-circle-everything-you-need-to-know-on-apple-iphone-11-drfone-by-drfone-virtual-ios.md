## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Apple iPhone 11

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

![google chrome featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How Does Chrome Know Your Location?

Before discussing Google **Chrome's fake location**, it is important to know how Chrome detects your physical location. Google Chrome uses many ways to pinpoint your exact location, like your IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cell Tower data. Every internet connection has an IP address bound to a location that enables Chrome to identify your location.

Similarly, GPS location can easily be tracked if your phone device has it enabled. All the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections around you also have location information embedded in them. They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.

## Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?

If you are worried about Google Chrome detecting your physical location and sharing it with websites and apps, you can hide it easily. The process of hiding your location on Google Chrome is simple, even if you are using multiple devices. Below is the step-by-step process of hiding location services in Google Chrome on computer, Android, and iOS devices.

### Method 1: For Laptop and Desktop PCs

**Step 1:** Launch Google Chrome on your computer and click the "Three Dots" icon to open the Google Chrome Settings. Here, tap "Privacy and Security" from the left sidebar and select "Site Settings."

**Step 2:** Navigate to "Permissions" and click on "Location." To hide the location on Google Chrome, select the "Don't allow sites to see your location" option.

![disable the location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-7.jpg)

One way to protect your privacy and stop websites from tracking your location is to turn off the location, but it has many disadvantages. If you have turned off your location, you can't use any location base service like food delivery, e-shopping, ride-sharing, etc. That's why it is better to use a fake location on your browser. Below we have explained four methods for **Chrome fake location**.

### Method 1. Best Tool to Fake Chrome Location On iOS and Android Phones

![hit the move here button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)



### Method 2. Manually Change Your Location Using Google Chrome DevTools

It is also possible to **fake browser location** on Chrome using the Google Chrome Developer Tools. It is a built-in feature of Chrome and can be used to manually change or turn off your browser's location. Follow these steps for changing location on Chrome with DevTools:

**Step 1:** After opening Google Chrome, click the three-dots icon from the top right corner. It will open the Chrome menu where you need to select "Developer Tools" after clicking "More Tools."

![choose the developer tools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-11.jpg)

**Step 2:** A window will open on the right side with all the developing tools you can use in Chrome. Click on the three-dots icon located near "Console" in the bottom left corner of the window. Choose "Sensors" from the pop-up menu.

![select the sensors option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-12.jpg)

**Step 3:** Access the newly selected "Sensor" option, and here you can change the browser's location by either selecting a Google's pre-set location or adding your desired location manually. Once the location is selected or added, your browser's location will change.

![select your location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-13.jpg)

**Limitations**

- The interface of the Google Chrome DevTools can be very confusing and overwhelming for non-technical users.
- Apart from pre-added locations, it can be hard to add a specific location as your fake location.

### Method 3. Fake Your Location Using Chrome Extension

Many **fake location Chrome extensions** are available on Google Chrome which can be used to alter your location on Chrome. You can find these extensions on Google Chrome Web Store and add them directly to your browser. Below we have explained the steps for using such an extension "[Location Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/location-guard/cfohepagpmnodfdmjliccbbigdkfcgia?hl=en)" to fake your location on Google Chrome:

**Step 1:** Open the "Location Guard" on Chrome Web Store and click "Add to Chrome" to add it to your browser. Once the "Location Guard" extension is added, open it and press "Options."

![install the location guard extension](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-14.jpg)

**Step 2:** In the options, you can choose different options like Privacy Levels, Protection Area, and Time for Location Cache. It is recommended you choose a higher level for more protection.

![customize the settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-15.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can also use the "Fixed Location" feature to set up a fake location as a permanent location for your browser. The fixed location can be added by using the market or clicking on the desired place on the map.

![confirm the fixed location position](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-16.jpg)

**Limitations**

- Location Guard doesn't protect your IP address. It means some websites can still detect your real location using the IP address.
- The app is not updated for quite a while, that's why the map of the fixed location feature is quite restricted.

### Method 4. Spoof Your IP Using a VPN Server

Another way you can fool websites and your browser by displaying a **fake location online** is to use a VPN server. VPNs fake your IP address to fool websites and apps into detecting your location. [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) is a VPN that can be used to spoof your IP by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install NordVPN on your computer or phone and log in using your account. If you don't have a NordVPN account, you must create one first.

**Step 2:** If you want to just change the location of your device, you can select "Quick Connect." Using it will enable the program to automatically find the most suited fake location for you.

![tap on the quick connect button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-17.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can also choose the desired location as your fake Chrome location in NordVPN. To do that, scroll down the list of countries and locations and choose your desired locations to connect to.

**Limitations**

- NordVPN can only spoof your IP address and will not work for geo-restricted applications.
- Using a VPN usually affects your internet speed and can make browsing slower and more difficult.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1.What is Geolocation?

The HTML5 Geolocation API is a browser API used to determine a user's geographical location. Developers use it to build location-aware websites and apps that use users' locations as the basis for providing their services. It can detect location through GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IP addresses, etc.

![life360 for location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing.png)

Life360 works by sharing your GPS location on the map, allowing the members of your circle to view it. As long as your GPS location is turned on, those in your circle will always have access to your exact location. Life360 developers are continually releasing new features to improve their tracking function.

![life360 map showing circles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-1.png)

Some of the available Life360 features include notifying you when a member of your circle moves to a new point and it will send a help alert when there’s an emergency. In addition, the app automatically contacts the emergency contacts you added when you do this. However, this doesn’t change that it can get intrusive when you need some privacy. That’s why the next section covers how to turn Life360 off.

### 1\. **Turn Off Your Circle’s Location on Life360**

There is the possibility of limiting the details about your location to others in your circle. One way to turn Life360 without anyone knowing is by choosing a circle and disconnecting from them. The steps below break down the entire process.

- First, launch Life360 on your device and navigate to ‘settings.’ You can find it at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Next, choose a circle you want to stop sharing your location with at the top of the page.

![locate the circle on life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-3.png)

![pause location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-2.jpg)

### 2\. **Turn off Your Apple iPhone 11’s Airplane Mode**

Another option you have to stop sharing location on Life360 is by switching on Airplane mode. You can do this on your Android and iOS devices. Once you enable Airplane mode, you’ll see a white flag on your last saved location.

**For your iOS devices**: open ‘control center’ and tap on the ‘airplane mode’ button. Alternatively, you can go to settings and tap on ‘airplane mode’ to switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-6.png)

**For Android** owners wondering how to turn location off on life360 through Airplane mode, swipe down from the top of your screen and select the ‘Airplane mode’ icon. You can also turn it on by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘network & internet’ from the option displayed. Finally, find the airplane mode and switch it on.

![turn on airplane mode on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/04/4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-without-knowing-7.png)

These steps will help you turn off location sharing on Life360. However, the downside of using Airplane mode is that it prevents you from accessing the internet.

## Part 4: FAQ About Turn off Location on Life360

### 1\. **Are there any risks to turning off GPS location?**

Yes, there are some dangers associated with turning off location on Life360. No one knows where you are anymore, which could be dangerous in the case of an emergency.

### 2\. **Can Life360 track my location when I switch My Apple iPhone 11 off?**

When your phone is off, your GPS location is automatically disabled. Therefore Life360 won’t be able to track your location; it will only display your last logged location.

### 3\. **Does Life360 tell my circle when I turn off the location?**

Yes, it does. It will send a ‘location sharing paused’ notification to all your group members. Additionally, if you log out from Life360, it will notify your circle immediately.
