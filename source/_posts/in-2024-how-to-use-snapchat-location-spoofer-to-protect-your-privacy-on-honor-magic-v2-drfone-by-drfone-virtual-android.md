## How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Honor Magic V2?

People are very happy about Snapchat’s new Snap map feature. It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.

![snap map feature](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg)

This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.

This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!

## **Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?**

The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?

Yes, Absolutely!

There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.

**Ghost Mode:** The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -

**Step 1:** If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.

![track camera screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg)

**Step 2:** On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.

![find bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg)

**Step 3:** The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.

![location setting on snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg)

**Step 4:** The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.

![duration ghost mode](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg)

If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.

**Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone**

If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.

**Android**

The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.

**Step 1**: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.

![check location notification tray](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2**: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on/off.

![tap location on/off](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg)

**iPhone**

To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,

**Step 1:** Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.

![go to setting on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg)

**Step 2:** Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.

![tap privacy option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg)

**Step 3:** In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.

![click location services option](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg)

**Step 4:** Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.

![turn off location service](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg)

These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.

## **Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat**

If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.

[Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Step 1**: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.

![dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Now connect Your Honor Magic V2 to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3**: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 4**: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.

![set the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.

**VPN Service - NordVPN**

The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.

![nordvpn google play store](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.

![signup for quick connect](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.

![choose the server](https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg)

So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.

## **Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?**

A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.

**Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?**

A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.

**Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?**

A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.

## **Part 4: Conclusion**

Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.

## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Honor Magic V2

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.
