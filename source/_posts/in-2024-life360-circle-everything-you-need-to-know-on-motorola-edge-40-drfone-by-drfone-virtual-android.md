## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Motorola Edge 40

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

## Bonus Tips: How to Use HolaVPN and a Location Spoofer to Fake GPS on Pokémon?

HolaVPN is a VPN service that reroutes your internet traffic and hides your IP address. Unlike the Hola Fake GPS, the bandwidth and encryption levels allotted with the HolaVPN service are significant.

This means you can play Pokémon from any part of the world, access YouTube from another region, and so on.

### 2\. Why Use HolaVPN in Pokémon Go?

Various situations might prompt you to use HoleVPN in the Pokemon Go game. For example, some countries restrict players from downloading the Pokemon Go game or gaining full access to some in-game features.

Hola Fake GPS location is not the best application to change your GPS location. But if you are simply looking to access a restricted website because of IP location, HolaVPN can be helpful.

However, it is unsuitable for long-time use. For instance, Hola Fake GPS is known to monitor your online activity and collect information about you. So, it is best to use an advanced application like the Dr.Fone - Virtual Location as shown. As mentioned, Dr.Fone - Virtual Location uses the most advanced technology to spoof your GPS location, so apps like Pokémon Go can't find your actual GPS location.

**Step 3:** Here, we are learning how to achieve Manual Spotify Change Region. So, go with the Manual Mode

**Step 4:** Now the map will appear on the page, more clearly with the pin and a search box for entering coordinates will also display. You can update Spotify location there.

**Step 5:** The Joystick will show you the different directions and when you move it, your location on the map also changes. Settle on the one that best fits you and proceed.

## **Part 3: Best Tools for Fake GPS on Android**

We have seen how to chive the Spotify Location update using the tools that work great in iPhones. In fact, you can use Dr. Fone on Android as well. Here are some other efficient GPS Faking tools that you can specifically use with your Motorola Edge 40s.

**Hola Fake GPS**

Hola Fake GPS is a direct Android app that you can use to change country on Spotify.

**Step 1:** In the Google Play Store, Search for ‘Fake GPS-Location - Hola’. The app appears with a smiley pin-point as an icon. Click on that and install on your Motorola Edge 40.

![hola app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/hola-app-google-play-pic18.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, a map will appear showing your current location in the world. You can shift the pin to a new location or simply type the address into search bar.

![spotify location shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-spotify-shift-pic19.jpg)

**Step 3:** The location pin will slowly start moving from current location to new location. At any point if you want to ‘STOP’, you can click on the Stop button that is present on the screen at this point.

**Fake GPS by Lexa**

This is a free app that helps to Change region Spotify within a few minutes. You can also use it for making some advanced changes if you are gaming or trying to access restricted content on other apps.

**Step 1:** Go to the Google Play Store and download Fake GPS by Lexa.

**Step 2:** Once you launch the app, the mp with your current location will be displayed. Enter a new location in the search box.

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/detection-of-new-location-pic22.jpg)

**Step 3:** The app will try to detect the new location that you have entered. Once it is successfully done, you will find that your new location will reflect in all the apps that have access to your Motorola Edge 40’s location. Including Spotify.

## **Part 4: How to use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

The Virtual Private Network apps will change your server and your location and IP address will be masked completely. We suggest that you use NordVPN, that is quite easy to work with.

**Step 1:** Download NordVPN from the App Store or Google Play Store

![nordvpn app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic24.jpg)

**Step 2:** To change Location on Spotify, Sign Up and NordVPN will find the nearest server for you.

**Step 3:** If you do not prefer the server that they connected to you, disconnect from that server. You can update location on spotify using another server.

![change server using spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic26.jpg)

**Step 4:** Then go to ‘More Options’ > Servers > All countries and choose the country that you want. The same will reflect on Spotify too.
