**

The error can occur if the features (Pivot tables, charts, macros) used in the [Excel file get corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). However, there could be several other reasons behind the occurrence of the error. Let’s discuss them.

## **What Causes the "Errors were detected while saving Excel" Error?**

There are various reasons why you encounter this error. Here are some of them:

- Incompatible pivot table in the Excel file
- Large or uncompressed images in the Excel file
- File-sharing properties are not allowing file saving
- Excel file is corrupted
- Large-sized Excel file
- File version incompatibility
- VBA code is corrupted

## **Ways to Fix the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” Error**

You’re not able to save the Excel file if there is no storage space on your hard drive. So, first check if your hard drive has sufficient storage space to save the file. If this is not the case, then it might happen that your antivirus program is interrupting the saving process. To check this, temporarily disable your antivirus program and then try to save the file. If still your Excel is throwing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error, then follow the below given methods to fix the error:

###  **Method 1: Open the Excel in Safe Mode and Disable the Add-ins**

When you open Excel in safe mode, it opens without the third-party add-ins. This helps in finding out if any add-ins are causing the error.

 Here’s how to open the Excel in safe mode:

- Open the Run window by pressing **Windows key + R**.
- Type **excel /safe** in the Run window.  

    ![Excel Save Mode Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/excel-save-mode-command.jpg)?

- Next, click on **OK**.
- It will open Excel in safe mode.
- Now, try to open and save the affected file.

If you are able to save the file without any issue, then this means that the error has occurred due to third-party add-ins or settings. You can try disabling the add-ins to fix the issue. To do this, follow these steps:

- First, open Excel.
- Then, go to the **File** tab and click **Options**.

![Go To Options Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/go-to-options-window.jpg)

**_Note_**_: Disabling add-ins does not remove them from the system. To remove them permanently, you need to uninstall them._

### **Method 2: Check the Excel File Name**

Some users have observed this error when saving the Excel file with an invalid name. You can check the file name and ensure that it should not contain more than 218 characters. If the name exceeds the required limit, then try shortening the file name or move the file to a folder with a short path name.

###  **Method 3: Copy the Data from the Affected File to a New File**

If you are not able to save the Excel document, then try copying the data from the affected file to a new Excel file. Then, save the new file with a different name. This helps in resolving the issue.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide File Permissions**

You may experience the “Errors were detected while saving Excel" issue when you do not have desired permissions to modify the folder in which your Excel file is located.

## \[Solved\] Excel Spreadsheet Disappears after Opening

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing ‘Excel spreadsheet disappears after opening’ issue. The problem occurs when attempting to open an Excel file by double-clicking on the file icon or name. The Excel file opens blank grey screen.

![Excel blank screen](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img1.jpg)

Figure 1 - Excel Blank Screen

## **User Instances of ‘Excel Open But Can’t See Spreadsheet’ Issue**

**Instance 1:** The user said that _“Excel 2016 opens to a blank screen and everything is greyed out. Ribbons at the top of Excel are also not present”._

**Instance 2:** The user reported that _“Attempting to open a spreadsheet, either by double-clicking the file or by opening Excel, it opens but only a blank Excel window is visible. When trying to save that particular file, Excel behaves as though there is no file open at all and all the file saving options, such as save, save as, print, etc. are greyed out.”_

## **Causes Behind ‘Excel Open But Can’t See Spreadsheet’ Issue & the Solutions Thereof**

Following are some of the possible reasons behind the ‘Excel open but can’t see spreadsheet’ issue, along with their solutions:

### **Cause 1: Excel File is Hidden**

You may have saved the Excel sheet as a hidden document.

### **Solution: Unhide Excel File**

Verify if your Excel worksheet is hidden by following these steps:

- In Excel, click the **View** tab, and then click **Unhide**.

Note: If the ‘Hide’ tab under the View menu is greyed out, the sheet you’re trying to open is not hidden. In that case, proceed to the next workaround.

![unhide excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img2.jpg)

Figure 2 - Unhide Excel File

- A dialog box will pop-up showing the worksheet name that can be unhidden. For instance, below is an image of Unhide box that lists ‘Daily\_Reports’ spreadsheet under Unhide workbook.

![unhide excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/img3.jpg)

Figure 3 – Select and Unhide Excel Workbook

- Click **OK** to unhide your Excel sheet.

If this fails to work, there’s a possibility that the spreadsheet window pane may have slided to one side of the visible desktop. To bring back the displayed area, click the ‘Arrange All’ option under the View tab. If the issue persists, try the next solution.

### **Cause 2: Ignore Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) Option is Enabled**

Another reason behind the ‘Excel opens to a blank screen’ issue could be that the “Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)” checkbox is checked in Excel options.

Usually, when you double-click an Excel file, a DDE message is sent to Excel instructing it to open that particular file. But, if you have the ‘Ignore DDE’ option selected, the DDE message sent to Excel to open a workbook is ignored. As a result, the Excel workbook opens a blank screen.

### **Solution: Uncheck the Ignore DDE Option**

Make sure that the ‘Ignore DDE’ option is unchecked by performing these steps:

Note: Skip these steps for Excel 2019 and Excel Office 365.

- In your Excel window, click **File** > **Options**.

## **How to Open a Corrupt Excel File without Backup?**

Following are some manual methods that can help you open a corrupt Excel file:

### **Method 1: Repair Corrupt Excel File**

When attempting to open a corrupt file, Excel automatically starts ‘File Recovery’ mode to repair the file. But, if the recovery mode doesn’t start, try Microsoft Excel’s built-in ‘Open and Repair’ feature to manually repair the file.

To use this feature, perform the following steps:

**Step 1:** Open a **Blank workbook** in Excel, and then click **File > Open**.

**Step 2:** In the **Open** window, browse and select the corrupt file.

**Step 3:** Click the arrow that is beside the **Open** tab, and select **Open and Repair**.

Open and Repair Option

**Step 4:** Implement one of the following:

- Click the **Repair** button. (This is to recover as much data as possible.)
- Click the **Extract Data** button. (This is to recover values and formulas from the Excel file if the repair process fails to recover the entire data.)

If using [Open and Repair does not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), move to the next method.

### **Method 2: Disable the Protected View Feature**

**Step 1:** Open a blank Excel file, click on **File** > **Options**.

**Step 2:** In the **Excel Options** window, select **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.

Excel Trust Center Settings

**Step 3:** Click **OK.**

Now check if you can open the corrupt file. If not, try implementing the next method.

### **Method 3: Look For Automatically Recovered Excel File**

**The ‘AutoRecover’** feature saves Excel worksheets at a temporary location after a certain time interval. It saves the worksheets automatically and is turned on by default to reduce the chance of data loss.
