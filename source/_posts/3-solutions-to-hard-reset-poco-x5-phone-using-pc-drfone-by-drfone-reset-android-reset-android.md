### 1: Can't Unlock it (forgot password, too many wrong attempts)

Most people **hard reset Poco X5** because they forgot the lock screen password. When you can't remember your phone's password, a hard reset is the fastest way to unlock your device. With a hard reset, you can delete all types of data and settings from your device. It helps you remove passwords, PINs, patterns, and fingerprint locks.
