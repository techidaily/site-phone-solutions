    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Xiaomi 13 Ultra and it failed terribly. Does Xiaomi 13 Ultra come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Xiaomi 13 Ultra on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
