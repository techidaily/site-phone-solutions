The Excel filter usually fails to work if you have not selected the complete and correct range of data. Let’s learn more about the “Sort and Filter not working in Excel” issue and look at the possible methods to fix it.

## **Why the Filter is not Working in Excel?**

You can face the “filter is not working” issue if you are applying the filter on a protected worksheet or trying to find the data from a hidden row. Besides this, there could be many other reasons contributing to this issue, such as:

- The data you are trying to filter is in merged cells.
- The Excel file automatically selected the data up to the first empty cell, excluding the remaining rows.
- Grouped sheets in Excel file.
- Blank row in the Excel sheet.
- You are trying to apply a filter on an invalid data range.
- The workbooks in which you’re facing the filter issues are corrupted.
- You are specifying incorrect criteria in the filter columns.

## **Solutions to Resolve the Filter is not Working Issue in Excel**

There might be two scenarios: the Excel filter option is disabled/grayed out or the filters fail to function properly. You can follow the given troubleshooting solutions to resolve the issue based on the scenario you’re facing.

## **Scenario 1 – Filter Option is Disabled or Grayed Out**

### **Method 1: Check and Un-group the Worksheet**

When you apply filters to a single sheet in a grouped set, Excel disables the filter option in other sheets within the group. You can check the grouped sheets and try ungrouping them to enable the filter option. Here’s how to do so:

- In the Excel file, go to the **Group** section.

![Excel file navigation: Accessing the Group section

- Right-click on the **Ungroup Sheets.**

Alternatively, you can press the Shift + Alt + Left keys to ungroup the sheets.

### **Method 2: Unprotect Worksheet**

The “disabled Excel filter” issue can also occur if your worksheet is protected. You can unprotect the worksheet to enable the filter option. To do so, go to the **Review** tab and then select **Unprotect Sheet.**

![Excel file: Navigating to Group section, resolving 'disabled Excel filter' issue with worksheet protection, unprotecting sheet from Review tab for filter activation.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-review-and-select-unprotect-sheet-1024x115.jpg)

### **Method 3: Check and Uninstall Excel Add-ins**

Sometimes, the Excel filter gets disabled due to faulty or corrupted Excel add-ins. You can run the Excel in Safe mode to check whether the issue has occurred due to add-ins. To do this, type excel /safe in the Run window and click **OK.**

![Troubleshooting disabled Excel filter caused by add-ins: Running Excel in Safe mode with 'excel /safe' in Run window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/type-excel-safe-command.jpg)

In safe mode, if you see the filter option, it indicates some problematic Excel add-ins were causing the issue. In such a case, you can check and uninstall the faulty Excel add-ins to fix the issue.

## **Scenario 2 – Filter is not Working**

### **Method 1: Try Clearing Filters**

Sometimes, the Excel filter fails to work correctly if some filters from the previous sessions are still active. In such a case, you can clear the applied filters. Follow the below steps:

- In Excel file, click Sort & Filter option.
- Select clear.

![Excel: Clicking 'Sort & Filter' and selecting 'Clear' option.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/click-clear-option.jpg)

### **Method 2: Select Entire Data**

The filter not working issue in Excel can occur when the range selected for filtering is incomplete or incorrect. You need to make sure that you’ve selected the entire data range in Excel. You can use the Ctrl+A keys to select the entire content in the worksheet.

### **Method 3: Check and Delete Blank Cells from the Table’s Columns**

To resolve this issue, check and delete all blank cells. In case your Excel file is too large to delete the blank cells, then you can add a “Serial number” row as an alternative. Adding serial number row creates a data continuity, thus helping in fixing the filter-related issue.

### **Method 4: Unhide Hidden Rows and Columns**

Hidden rows or columns in worksheets can also affect the filter functionality. You can check and unhide rows/columns to troubleshoot the issue. Here is how to do so:

- In the affected Excel file, go to Home.
- Click on **Format > Hide & Unhide**.

## How to Fix Excel File Couldn't Open in Protected View

**Summary:** This blog discusses about the Excel error 'The file couldn't open in Protected View' and workarounds to fix the error. If you cannot access the Excel file data, using an Excel file repair tool can help you quickly restore the data to its original state.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Protected View is a feature in Microsoft Excel that opens a file in read-only mode while disabling the editing functions. An Excel file opens in Protected View if the file is from an unsafe location. For example, the file may be opened from an insecure Internet location or downloaded as an Outlook attachment from suspicious senders. In that case, your Excel application won’t let you open the file to protect it against malware or virus attacks.

However, the Protected View feature sometimes prevents an Excel file from opening even if it is from a safe location. Also, opening an Excel file may return an error message ‘file couldn’t open in protected view’.

![the file couldn't open in Protected View excel error](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/file-couldnt-open-in-protected-view-error-1.png)

You may be able to resolve the issue by closing all the open Excel files, closing the Excel application, and then re-opening the problematic file. But this process can take a significant amount of time as you need to close and re-open the Excel application and the file continuously.

## **How to Fix the Excel File Couldn’t Open in Protected View Error?**

Here are some workarounds to fix the error:

### **Workaround 1 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

**Note:** Before disabling the protected view settings, ensure you have a reliable antivirus software installed on your computer to safeguard files against malware or virus attacks.

- Open the Excel file throwing the error, go to **File** and click the **Options** tab.
- From the Options dialog box, go to **Trust Center** and click on **Trust Center Settings**.
- From the Trust Center Settings dialog box, select the **Protected View** tab.
- Uncheck the appropriate option under the Protected View section, and then click **OK** to apply the changes. For instance, uncheck the “Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments” option if the file is a downloaded Outlook attachment.

![disable protected view settings ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/disable-protected-view-2.png)

- Click **OK** again.

Now try opening the problematic Excel file. If it still doesn’t open, try the following workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Repair the Office Installation**

Sometimes, corruption in the Office installation may cause Excel to return the ‘file could not open in protected view’ error. So, try repairing your Office installation and check if it solves the problem.

- Open the Control Panel and click the **Uninstall a program** option under **Programs**.
- Click **Uninstall a program** under the **Programs** tab.
- Right-click the Microsoft Office program you have installed and click the **Change** button.
- Select the **Repair** option and click **Continue**.

![repair office program](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/online-repair-microsoft-office-app-3-1024x387.png)

Once the repair operation is complete, check if you can open the Excel file without any issue.

### **Workaround 3 – Install Latest MS Office Updates**

Several Excel users have reported about experiencing [issues](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54) (such as the Protected View issue) on opening an Office document like Excel, Word, or others – after upgrading Windows to a newer version. This problem may occur due to incompatibility between the Office app and the updated Windows version. You can try to fix the problem by upgrading the Office app, and here’s how:

- Click on the **File** tab in the Excel file that throws an error.
- Click the **Account** tab at the left-hand bottom of the screen.
- From Office Updates, expand **Update Options**, and then click **Update Now**.

![office updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/update-excel-4.png)

After installing the updates, restart your PC and open the Excel file. If this doesn’t work, use the following workaround.

## **Workaround 4 – Convert the File and Rename It**

Some Excel users resolved the ‘Protected view’ issue by renaming their Excel files. But before that, ensure that the file you are trying to open is saved with .xlsx format. If the file type is .xls, you need to convert it to .xlsx format and then rename it. Before converting the file, save a copy of the original file in the desired location.

If the file type is .xlsx, copy the problematic file. Next, open a blank Excel document and paste the copied file. The file will appear as an icon, double-click on it. If it opens without any error, save it with a different name. Hopefully, reaming the Excel file may help resolve the problem.

## **Conclusion**

There is no fixed solution to resolve the Excel error ‘The file could not open in Protected View’. However, the workarounds discussed in the blog have helped users resolve the ‘Protected View’ issue. Make sure to use the workarounds in the same order as explained in the blog.

If you’re having an issue loading the Excel file data due to the ‘Protected View’ error, consider restoring the data using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

## How to Repair Excel Document on a Flash Drive

**Summary:** Microsoft Excel files are stored on flash drives if they need to be transferred between systems or if they need to be backed up. But sometimes unforeseen issues can corrupt the Excel sheets stored on flash drives. When that happens, it can be an arduous task to repair Excel documents on a flash drive. Through this post let us try to understand the reasons why Excel sheets stored on flash drives can get corrupted and how users can resolve them easily.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

In this digital age, we all work with computers, files, and documents. Flash drives or USBs are common ways of storing data in an external place. Be it for a meeting or for a party playlist, these devices come handy when one wants to transfer data or access the files stored elsewhere.

You may need to access your data from another location. That’s when a USB flash drive might come in handy. And, that’s exactly why Excel sheets too end up on flash drives; either that or for backup purposes. However, there are many instances where an Excel file stored in a USB gets corrupted when one tries to access the file. The error message you get while trying to open the Excel file would be a great clue for figuring out the exact reason behind corruption.

This blog will provide insights into what are the reasons for the corruption of a USB and how the users can repair Excel on flash drive that has been corrupted.

## **Reasons for USB inaccessibility**

Sometimes flash drives or USBs can become unresponsive due to numerous reasons. There are two types of corruption – logical and physical. Physical corruptions occur due to broken stems and connectors, broken circuits, NAND gate, not recognised, RAW, need to format, not accessible, and dead drives (no power supply).

One of the main reasons behind such an error could be that the USB drive has been infected by some virus. This can affect any file – not only the ones which are there in the USB drive but also the ones which are there in the PC/Laptop where you connect the USB drive. It is recommended that you scan the USB drive with reliable antivirus software to detect viruses.

There can be various other reasons that may make your USB corrupt or unresponsive. But there are very slim chances that you will be able to recover a flash drive that has physical damage. However, you can try to run the check disk on the USB drive to fix the drive. We will be discussing this as you read on.

## **Recovery Methods for Corrupted Flash Drives**

There are 3 tried and tested recovery methods. Try them and see which one works out for you.

1. **Restoring Excel Files from Windows backup**

To bring back your old Excel files, fixing up the corrupt file is your best option. Importantly note that this method would work only if your system’s Windows backup option has been enabled.

**Step-by-step process for restoring your older Excel files:**

- Connect your USB drive
- Go to “My Computer”->USB Drive->Check if the file exists
- Right click on the excel file and click on the restore previous versions

![Restore Previous Versions](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/restore-previous-version-of-Excel.jpg)

- You will now see a list of older versions which were created
- Select one the backups and click on “restore”

2. **Using Command Line to Recover Excel Files**

In case you are looking to repair Excel on flash drive, you can also resolve it by using the command line. Just follow the below steps to see if you can recover the excel files.

- Connect your USB Flash drive
- Open “Run” (press Windows+R) and then open “cmd”

![Windows+R cmd](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cmd.jpg)

- Type “attrib -h -r -s /s /d (USB Drive Letter):\\\*.\*” where the (USB Drive Letter) is the drive letter you can find using “My Computer”
- Once this has been completed, Windows will start repairing your files
- After the process gets over, try accessing the excel file to see if the data has been recovered

3. **Running a “Check Disk” on flash drives**

Follow the below steps while the USB flash drive has been plugged into your computer:

- Open “Run” and then open “cmd”
- Type in “chkdsk /X /f (USB Drive Letter)” where the “(USB Drive Letter)” is the letter of the corrupted USB Drive. You can get this letter easily from the “My Computer”.

![chkdsk  command prompt](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/check-disk.jpg)

It will now check your disk to and correct any corrupted records.

## **What if none of these methods works?**
