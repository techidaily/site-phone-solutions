The audio is ok but the video is in green and black and seems like five pictures tiled. How could I possibly repair the corrupted MP4 file? The video clip is very important and memorable for me. Thanks."</p></div><div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content"><p><strong>Know some of the instances that cause video corruption…</strong>  <li>Interruptions while transferring video files from one system to any device or vice versa</li>  <li>Using unreliable software for recovering the lost or deleted videos</li>  <li>Video file header corruption</li>  <li>Frequently converting your video file format</li>  <li>Trying to play video file on an unsupported media player</li></p>In all such instances your video files from Honor X9a might get corrupt and become unplayable.
