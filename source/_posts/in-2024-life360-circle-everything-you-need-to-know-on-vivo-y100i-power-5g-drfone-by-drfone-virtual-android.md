## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Vivo Y100i Power 5G

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

## How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Vivo Y100i Power 5G?

Life360 is an online platform that utilizes geo-location services to help users share their real-time location with friends and family. The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.

As of now, you cannot run **_Life360 on computer_** as it is only available for Android and iOS. _Why?_ Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.

However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the **_Life360 app for Windows_**. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the **_Life360 app on Windows_**.

So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.

## Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?

First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get **_Life360 for PC_**. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.

In this situation, you can simply run the **_Life360 app on PC_**. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.

Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.

## Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?

Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.

The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.

However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and **_run the app on a Windows PC_**. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.

These methods include:

## Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator

The first and the most convenient way to run **_Life360 on computer_** is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.

While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.

Here’s how you can run **_Life360 on a computer_** using Bluestacks Android emulator./

Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.

Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.

![bluestacks 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg)

Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.

![bluestacks 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg)

Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.

![bluestacks 13](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg)

Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.

![bluestacks 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg)

Step 6: Life360 is now installed on your computer. Open the app and enter your login details. You’ll now be able to run Life360 on your PC.

![bluestacks 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-5.jpg)

## Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC

While running an emulator is a great way to get **_Life360 on PC_,** it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.

In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run **_Life360 on PC_**. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.

Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.

Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.

![mirroring android 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg)

Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.

![mirroring android 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg)

Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.

![mirroring android 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg)

Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.

![mirroring android 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg)

Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer. Any action that you perform on your device will be replicated on your computer screen as well.

## Final Verdict

Life360 is probably among the top family locators for Android users. Apart from its extensive range of features, the app provides a user-friendly interface, which allows it easier for even elders to use the app without any issues. Even though there isn’t a dedicated Life360 software for Windows, you can follow the above-mentioned methods to run the **_Life360 on PC_**.

## iSpoofer is not working On Vivo Y100i Power 5G? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Vivo Y100i Power 5G device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)
