If you are experiencing the ‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet’ error message in the Excel workbook, it indicates that the [Excel file is corrupt](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) or partially damaged. However, it may also occur due to incorrect reference to a wrong cell or object linking, which is not working. The complete error message says,

_‘Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet. Check that the cell references, range names, defined names, and links to other workbooks in your formulas are all correct.’_

![Excel found a problem with one or more formula references](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-problem-with-formula-reference.png)

In any case, resolving the error is critical as it doesn’t let you save the file and may result in loss of information from the Excel workbook.

## Reasons for Excel Formula References Error

A few reasons that may lead to such error are as follows,

- Wrong formula or reference cell
- Incorrect object linking or link embedding OLE
- Empty or no values in named or range cells
- Multiple Excel files (not common)

## Methods to Resolve ‘Excel Found a Problem with One or More Formula References in this Worksheet’ Error

Following are a few methods that you can follow to [fix Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) that can’t be saved due to problems with one or more formula references in the worksheet.

### Method 1: Check Formulas

If the problem has occurred in a large Excel workbook with multiple sheets, it’s quite hard to pinpoint the problem cell. In such cases, you can use the Error Checking option that runs a scan and checks for a problem with formulas used in the worksheet.

To run Error Checking in the Excel sheet, follow these steps,

- Go to Formulas and click on the ‘Error Checking’ button

![Error Checking](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-error-checking-1024x431.png)

- This runs a scan on the sheet and displays the issues, if any. If no issue is found, it displays the following message,

_The error check is completed for the entire sheet._

In such a case, you can try saving the Excel file again. If the error message persists, proceed to the next method.

### Method 2: Check Individual Sheet

The problem may also occur due to an issue with one of the sheets in the workbook. To find the faulty sheet and fix the problem, you can copy each sheet content in a new Excel file and then try to save the Excel file.

This will help you find the faulty sheet from the workbook that you can review. This method makes the entire [process of troubleshooting Excel formula](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) reference error quite easy and convenient.

In case the error is not fixed, you can back up the faulty sheet content and remove it from the workbook to save the Excel file.

### Method 3: Check Links

When the Excel file contains external links with errors, MS Excel may display such error messages. To check and confirm if external links are causing the error, follow these steps,

- Navigate to _Data Tab > Queries & Connections > Edit Links_
- Check the links. If you find any faulty link, remove it and then save the sheet

### Method 4: Review Charts

You can review the charts to check if they are causing the formula reference error in Excel. It may take a while based on the size of the Excel file. Sometimes, it’s not practically possible to track down which Excel chart object is causing the error. Thus, you need to check specific locations, such as:

1. Check horizontal axis formula inside Select Data Source dialog box
2. Check Secondary Axis
3. Check linked Data Labels, Axis Labels, or Chart Title

### Method 5: Check Pivot Tables

To check Pivot Tables, follow these steps,

- Navigate to _PivotTable Tools > Analyze > Change Data Source > Change Data Source…_

![Edit links](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MS-Excel-Edit-Links-1024x84.png)

- Check if any of the formula used is problematic. Sometimes small typo, such as misplaced comma, can lead to such problems in Excel. Thus, check each formula thoroughly and correct the formulas wherever needed.

### Method 6: Use Excel Repair Software

When none of the methods resolve the error, then you can rely on advanced [Excel repair software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), such as Stellar Repair for Excel.

Similar to any other program, you may experience problems with Microsoft Excel while opening or working on a document. Sometimes, it may not start at all or freeze and display an error message such as ‘Excel is not responding’. When it happens, you may want to wait for the program to respond.

![Microsoft Excel is not Responding ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Microsoft-Excel-not-responding.png)

‘Microsoft Excel is not responding’ problem

And thus, leading to an Excel freeze or crash problem. Use Stellar Repair for Excel software to quickly repair and restore Excel (.xls/.xlsx) file in its original, intact form. You can download the free trial version of the software from the below link.

But if Excel doesn’t respond after a while and remains stuck, you need to force close the program from “**Task Manager**”. Now, this could be disastrous if happens while you are working on an important Excel document that took you hours to prepare. Force closing Excel due to such error can damage the Excel document and it may fail to open next time.

## **Why Excel is Not Responding?**

Excel may stop responding, freeze, or crash suddenly due to several reasons. It can happen while saving a spreadsheet or opening an Excel document. It may also occur while editing or inserting images, graphs, etc. But usually, it occurs when the system crashes or shuts down abruptly while you are working on a document. Here’s an instance,

_Suppose, you worked overnight on a critical document which is to be presented at a meeting the next day. This Excel spreadsheet includes critical graphs and charts, and much more. When you are about to save it, there is a power failure, and your system shuts down without warning. When the power is up, you restarted the system to check your Excel. To your dismay, a message pops up – “Excel Crashed” or “Microsoft Excel not responding”._

This could be frustrating. However, there is no need to despair as there are solutions to not just overcome this error but other corresponding issues such as Excel freezing, hanging, crashing, etc. Below is an infographic that quickly briefs all the possible solutions to fix Excel not responding error.

## **Solutions to Fix ‘Microsoft Excel is not responding’ Error**

Follow the solutions discussed below in the given order to fix Excel freezing and hanging issues.

### **Solution 1**: **Open Excel in Safe Mode**

If Excel is not working as intended and frequently stops responding, you may try to start Excel in Safe Mode. It is a common DIY way to fix ‘Excel is not responding’ problem.

In Safe Mode, Excel starts with only essential services, bypasses certain functionalities and doesn’t load the add-ins, which might be the reason behind the error in MS Excel . To open and troubleshoot Excel in **Safe Mode**:

- Press **Windows + R** keys, type **excel.exe /safe and press ‘Enter’ or click ‘OK’**

![MS Excel in Safe Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Excel-safe-mode-1024x523.png)

MS Excel in Safe Mode

Open the Excel file and check if it still crashes. If not, the problem could be a faulty add-in or formatting and styling error.

Proceed to the next solution to check and fix the problem.

### **Solution 2: Check for Faulty and Unwanted Add-ins**

**In Microsoft Excel, there are two types of add-ins:**

- **COM add-ins**
- **Other Add-ins Installed as XLAM, XLA, or XLL File**

**Both types of add-ins can cause the freezing problem in Excel . Follow the steps below to disable unwanted and faulty add-ins:**

- In Excel , click **File and g**o to **Options** to open ‘**Excel Options**’ window
- Click **Add-ins** button to view and manage ‘**Microsoft Office Add-ins**’
- Uncheck required add-ins to disable them
- At this stage, you can also click the ‘**Remove**’ button to remove any unwanted add-ins

![Disable COM Add-Ins](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Remove-COM-Addins.jpg)

Disable COM Add-Ins

- Now enable an add-in and check the Excel performance. Observe Excel for not responding error or freezing problem

If Excel doesn’t freeze, enable subsequent add-in and then again use Excel to observe it. Repeat the steps until you find the faulty plugin, which is causing the problem.

Then remove it from Excel add-ins to resolve the problem.

### **Solution 3****:** **Install the latest Windows and Office Updates**

This problem may also occur if Windows and MS Office are not updated. Therefore, install the latest updates for both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office.

You can set the installation and update option to ‘**Automatic mode**’ in Windows. This will download and install critical updates for MS Office, which might fix the Excel performance issue. The steps to enable automatic updates are as follows:

1. Go to **Settings> Update & Security> Windows Update**

![Enable Automatic Windows updates](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/update-windows-1024x796.jpg)

Enable Automatic Windows updates

- Click **Advanced options** and enable all the toggle switches to automatically download and install updates for Windows and other Microsoft products

![Update Microsoft Products](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/upload-WIndows-Products-1024x796.jpg)

Update Microsoft Products

After update, restart Excel and check if the problem is resolved.

**_NOTE:_** _From now on, MS Excel will also get the latest update consistently, without the need for manual intervention._

### **Solution 4:  Check and Disable Anti-virus**

Antivirus is important for device safety. However, if your antivirus conflicts with MS Office apps such as Excel, it could lead to Excel freezing and not responding errors.

To check if the problem is due to anti-virus, disable it and reopen the Excel document. Check if Excel performs well or if it still hangs.

![Example of Antivirus conflict with Microsoft Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Antivirus.jpg)

Example of Antivirus conflict with Microsoft Excel

If the problem is resolved, contact your antivirus software provider for help to keep antivirus running without affecting the system and other programs such as MS Excel.

### **Solution 5: Change the ‘Default Printer’**

Although it may seem irrelevant, changing the default printer is another easy and effective solution to overcome the error. Reason being, Excel communicates with the printer to find supported margins when we open an Excel sheet.

If Excel doesn’t find the supported margin, it may stop responding or crash. The steps to change the default printer are as follows:

1. Open **Control Panel** on your Windows system
2. Click **Printer and Devices**
3. Right-click **Microsoft XPS Document Writer** to set it to the default printer

![Change in Default Printer Setting](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Default-Printer-Setting-1.jpg)

Change in Default Printer Setting

Reopen the Excel document to check whether the error occurs or not.

### **Solution 6: Repair Microsoft Office**

A corrupt or damaged Microsoft Office can also cause the ‘Excel is not responding’ problem. You can resolve this by repairing the Microsoft Office files. The steps are as follows:

1. **Close** all running MS Office programs
2. Go to **Control Panel** on your Windows system
3. Click **Programs** and then **Programs** **and** **Features**
4. Select **Microsoft Office** and in the Microsoft Office window, click ‘**Change**’
5. Then select the ‘**Repair**’ option and click ‘**Continue**’

![Repair MS Office](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Repair-MS-Office.jpg)

Repair MS Office

This may take a while. After the repair is done, check your Excel program and file for the error.

### **Solution 7: Remove and Reinstall Microsoft Office**

Sometimes, repairing MS Office may not work. In such a case, removing and reinstalling Microsoft Office can resolve the ‘Excel is not responding’ problem. To do so, follow these steps:

1. **Close** all running MS Office programs
2. Go to **Control Panel** on your Windows system
3. Click **Programs** and then **Programs** **and** **Features**
4. Right-click on **Microsoft Office** and choose **Uninstall**

Uninstall MS Office

Then run the MS Office installation setup to re-install MS Office on your system.

      ' Store the current font size
      fntSZ = ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size

'Temporarily change the font size.
      ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size = 2

'Place your LegendEntries macro code here to make
         'the changes that you want to the chart legend.

' Restore the font size.
      ActiveChart.Legend.Font.Size = fntSZ
   End With

End Sub
Note: Make sure you have an Excel chart to run the code on the worksheet.
```

### Solution 3: Check and Install the Latest Updates

If you haven't set Windows to Download and Install Updates automatically, do it now.

Apart from updating the operating system, latest Windows updates sometimes fixes bugs for other applications installed on the system such as MS Office. Often installing an important update that you might have missed may correct the Excel crash problem.

You can also update MS Office manually. Follow these steps,

Go to File > Account

 Under Product Information, select Update Options and click Update Now

![Product Information](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/excel12.jpg)

## \[Fixed\] Excel PivotTable Overlap Error | Troubleshooting Guide

In Excel, you need to refresh the pivot table data source after adding new data. However, sometimes, while refreshing the pivot table, you may experience an error “PivotTable Report cannot Overlap.” This issue usually appears when there are multiple pivot tables in a single worksheet. It often occurs when you try to place one pivot table on top of another or if you try to set a common cell range to multiple pivot tables. However, there are many other causes associated with the error.

## **Reasons for a pivot table report cannot overlap another pivot table report issue:**

- Merged cells in a pivot table may cause the overlap issue
- Using the same range of cells for multiple pivot tables
- Hidden columns
- Preserve formatting option is enabled
- Modifying the pivot table using a macro that is corrupted
- Using the workbook.RefreshAll method incorrectly
- Number of pivot items goes beyond the number of cells available
- Excel file is corrupt
- [Corrupted Pivot table](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)
- Some columns are labeled with the same name

## Methods to Fix Excel PivotTable Report Cannot Overlap Error

You can get the pivot table overlapping issue if the field in pivot table crossed the maximum items limit. According to the Microsoft guide, you can specify up to 1,048,576 items to return per field. Check the cell fields in your pivot table. Also, make sure each column’s label is unique. Sometimes, the hidden columns or hidden sheets can also prevent you from modifying the pivot tables. You can check for hidden columns in the Data view.

If the error still persists, then try the below-mentioned methods to fix the error.

### **1\. Move the Pivot Table to a New Worksheet**

The “PivotTable Report cannot Overlap” error can occur if there is an issue with the columns in the pivot table. In this case, you can try moving the pivot table to a new worksheet. Moving the pivot table to a different worksheet automatically resets the column width according to the new sheet and creates space that can help in preventing the overlapping issue. Here are the steps to do so:

### **2\. Disable the Background Refresh Option**

When the background refresh option is enabled, then Excel updates the pivot table in the background after every minor change. It may create issue if you have a large-sized Excel file with multiple pivot tables. You can try disabling the background refresh option. Here’s how:

- The **Connection Properties** dialog box is displayed. Unselect the “**Enable background refresh”** option and select the **“Refresh data when opening the file”**
- Click **OK.  

    ![enable background refresh in connection properties window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivottable/enable-background-refresh-in-connection-properties-window.jpg)

    **

### **3\. Disable Autofit Column Widths**

When the Autofit column widths option is enabled, Excel automatically resizes the pivot table whenever you make changes to it. These automatic adjustments can sometimes add or remove fields which can result in the PivotTable Report cannot Overlap issue. To fix this, you can disable the “Autofit column widths on update” option. To do this, follow these steps:

- Right-click on any field on the pivot table.
- Select **PivotTable Options.  

    ![Select Pivot Table](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/Recover-Excel-Files/pivottable/select-pivot-table.jpg)
