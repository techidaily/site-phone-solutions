Alright, I know it’s next to impossible that you will ever forget your passcode but we cannot overlook the fact that, yes there is a chance that you may forget it.

That said, let’s delve into some of the best solutions for forgotten iPhone password.  
If you’ve forgotten the password, these options will help you out:

- Erase your iOS device with iTunes to remove the password
