SERP results are generated based on the intent behind the search query, for example, if someone is searching for a product, it will show the shopping pack, if someone is searching for a news, it will show the top stories pack.

## 1. Analyze SERP for the keyword to know how difficult it will be to rank

The SERP Analysis feature lets you analyze the top 50 pages ranking for any keyword and find the most influential ranking factors.

- 01 Enter any keyword
- 02 Collect data on the top 50 competitors
- 03 Analyze ranking factors
- 04 See which factors correlate with SERP positions

### 1.1. To initiate the analysis

Go to the SERP Analysis tab in the navigation panel on the left. Choose a preferred search engine, enter your key term, and click Analyse.

### 1.2. Get all important data in one dashboard

The top part of the dashboard is a quick summary of SERP stats, while the bottom part is the table with the data for all 50 ranking pages.

1. Gauge keyword potential at a glance
   A quick way to estimate keyword potential is to look at keyword difficulty vs search volume. Keywords that have very strong competitors but bring little traffic are unlikely to be worth your effort.
   ![Gauge keyword potential at a glance](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/link-assistant/rank-tracker/serp-analysis/slide1-screen-1.png)
2. Find main ranking factors
   For each keyword, the free SERP checker finds if there is a correlation between different ranking factors and the pages' actual position in search. Sometimes it's more important to compete on backlinks, while other times you might have better luck optimizing for user experience. This feature removes the guesswork and tells you the best area to focus on.

3. Analyze search results in-depth
   We calculate the difficulty rating based on the backlink profile of a competitor. In particular, we look at the number of links to a page and a domain as well as the number of linking domains. This information is available for each of the top 50 search results.
   ![Analyze search results in-depth](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/link-assistant/rank-tracker/serp-analysis/slide1-screen-3.png)
4. See keyword and traffic stats
   For each competitor, we also look at the overall presence in search. We track the number of keywords that the domains rank for as well as the amount of traffic they are likely to attract through their positions in search. This information is also available for each of the top 50 search results.
   ![See keyword and traffic stats](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/link-assistant/rank-tracker/serp-analysis/slide1-screen-4.png)
5. See UX metrics for each competitor
   User experience is a costly thing to optimize. The good news is that you don't need a perfect score, you just have to be slightly better than your competitors in SERP. And with our data, you'll know exactly what the benchmark is.

## 4. See SERP fluctuation for the keyword and for the project

When search engines update their ranking algorithms, for many websites positions and rich feature arrangements may change. These ranking changes create fluctuations in search results, based on which the SERP checker displays a Fluctuation Graph — the proprietary metric to help you understand search engine trends that matter for your business niche.

![See SERP fluctuation for the keyword and for the project](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/link-assistant/rank-tracker/serp-analysis/fluctuation-graph.png)

The graph depicts recent and historical changes in the top 30 search results in each of your target search engines, for any individual keyword separately or for all your keywords together. Red spikes on your graph indicate that the real-time SERP has changed significantly on that day, implying a possible algorithm change.
