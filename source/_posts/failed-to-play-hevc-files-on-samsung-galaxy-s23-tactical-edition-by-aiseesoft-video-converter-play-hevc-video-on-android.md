      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition would be a workable solution.
