    Wanna watch MTS clips copied from your AVCHD camera on Samsung Galaxy M54 5G? AVCHD is a popular file-based format for digital recording and playback of high-definition video. Most Android phones or tablets lack native support for AVCHD MTS footage. You can either use a third party media player like VLC or MX player to play MTS files on your Samsung Galaxy M54 5G, or convert AVCHD footage to MP4 format that is well compatible with Samsung Galaxy M54 5G.

  “I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do with AVCHD .mts files on my Samsung Galaxy M54 5G. They were taken with a Panasonic camera. I’d like to watch them on Samsung Galaxy M54 5G, but it refused to play them. So I'm stuck. Has anyone else figured out how to play the files in this .mts format on Samsung Galaxy M54 5G? Any suggestions?”
