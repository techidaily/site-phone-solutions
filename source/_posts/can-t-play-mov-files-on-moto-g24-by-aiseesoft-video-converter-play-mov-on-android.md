  “Hi guys, I just changed for the Motorola Moto G24 about half a month ago and I'm very pleased with it and don't regret leaving Apple, saving for iTunes compatibility. Anyways can anyone please tell me if there's a way I could play my .mov videos taken with my old iPhone on my Motorola Moto G24? Thanks.”

  Since Motorola Moto G24 does not support playback of .MOV files using its stock player, you will need to install a third party media player that supports QuickTime MOV, or process file conversion before the playback. To download a .mov player for your Motorola Moto G24, you can give VLC player, MX Player, BS Player and Mobo player a shot. To convert MOV files for viewing on Motorola Moto G24, you can give Video Converter a shot. You load your MOV files to this Converter app, and choose H.264 MP4 as output format. This will ensure the converted files have a good playback performance on your Motorola Moto G24.
