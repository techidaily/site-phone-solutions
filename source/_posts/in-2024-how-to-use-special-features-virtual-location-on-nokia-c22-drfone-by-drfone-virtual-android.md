### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to.

## Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?

Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.

However, if you're on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it's too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you're receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.

Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.

**Food Delivery**

Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren't made.

![location spoofing on food delivery driver apps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg)

**Gaming**

Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.

Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.

**Social Media**

Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.

**Financial Services**

Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.

There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including [mock location detection APKs](https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock) if you're on Android. These anti-spoofing GPS apps help detect if someone is providing fake GPS locations. However, if this is not available to you, there are several ways you can mitigate malicious actors by applying some safeguards.

![mock location detection apks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-04.jpg)

Here are some of the methods you can take advantage of.

- Cross-reference location data from multiple sources to detect fake GPS locations. You can cross reference from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell tower triangulation to analyze accurate GPS.
- Analyze abnormal patterns in location data presented to you from sudden jumps in location or having unrealistic speeds during movement.
- Verify the accuracy of GPS by comparing location data to known landmarks, including buildings, bridges, or roads.
- Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.
- Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user's smartphone.

While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it's important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods. You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you're on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.
