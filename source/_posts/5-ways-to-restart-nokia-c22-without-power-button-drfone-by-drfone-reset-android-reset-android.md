### The Bottom Line

Smartphones are a critical part of our personal and professional lives now. Keeping them updated, backed up, and fully functional is essential. If your phone has issues or you have forgotten your password, Nokia C22 hard reset is a reliable solution. However, it results in the wiping of data. On the other hand, you can use robust software like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) to solve your phone's performance or locking issues without data loss.
