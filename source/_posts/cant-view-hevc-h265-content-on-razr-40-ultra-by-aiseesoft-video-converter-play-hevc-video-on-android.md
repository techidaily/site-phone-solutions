      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra first. That’s where an HEVC to Motorola Razr 40 Ultra converter comes in.
