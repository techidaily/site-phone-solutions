## Fix the Too many different cell formats Error in Excel?

Excel has set a limit on the number of unique cell formats within a workbook. Excel 2003 allows up to 4000 different cell format combinations, whereas Excel 2007 and later versions allow a maximum of 64000 combinations. When this limit exceeds, you may encounter errors, such as “Too many different cell formats”. It can prevent you from inserting or modifying workbook rows or columns. Sometimes, it prevents you to copy and paste the content within the same or different workbooks.  This error may also occur due to various other reasons.

You can encounter the “Too many different cell formats” error due to the below reasons:

- Formatting is missing in the workbook.
- Size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive use of complex formatting (conditional formatting).
- Workbook contains a large number of merged cells.
- There are multiple built-in or custom cell styles.
- Excel workbook is corrupted.
- The unused styles are unexpectedly copied to new workbooks (when moving or copying a worksheet from one to another).
- Workbooks contain multiple worksheets with different cell formatting.

## **Methods to Fix the “Too many different cell formats” Error in Excel**

First, check that your Excel application is up-to-date. It helps in preventing duplicate styles in workbooks. If the error persists, then follow the below methods:

### **Method 1: Simplify the Workbook Formatting**

You can face the error in Excel - Too many different cell formats, if the size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive or unnecessary formatting. You can try to simplify the formatting of the affected workbook. While reducing the number of formatting combinations, you can follow the simplifying guidelines, such as using a standard font and applying borders consistently. Follow the below steps to remove unnecessary formatting in your worksheet:

- First, open the affected worksheet.
- Now, use the shortcut key (Ctrl+A) to select all the cells.
- In the Excel ribbon, navigate to the **Home** tab and click **Clear**.

![Clicking Clear in the Home tab of the Excel ribbon](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-excel-home-click-clear.jpg)

- Then, select the **Clear Formats** option.

![Choosing Clear Formats from the available options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/select-clear-formats-option.jpg)

The above steps will remove all unnecessary formatting from the selected cells, thus reducing the number of cell formats. Besides this, you can try removing the cell patterns (if any) or [use cell styles](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/apply-create-or-remove-a-cell-style-472213bf-66bd-40c8-815c-594f0f90cd22) to remove unnecessary formatting in the workbook.

### **Method 2: Remove Conditional Formatting**

Conditional formatting is also one of the reasons behind the “Too many different cell formats” error. It usually occurs if you have applied multiple rules to various cells or cell ranges within a workbook. Each rule has its own formatting settings. If you’ve applied a large number of conditional formatting to cells, it can increase the number of unique cell formats. You can check and remove the unnecessary conditional formatting. Here are the steps to do this:

- Open the Excel file in which you are getting the error.
- Go to the **Home** tab and locate **Conditional Formatting**.

![Finding Conditional Formatting in the Home tab](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-home-and-then-conditional-formatting.jpg)

- Select **Manage Rules**.

![Choosing Manage Rules from the available options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-rules.jpg)

- The **Conditional Formatting Rules Manager** wizard is displayed. You can check the formatting rules and delete the unnecessary rule by clicking on the **Delete Rule** option.

![View the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager displaying formatting rules; remove unnecessary rule using Delete Rule option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-delete-rule-option.jpg)

## Excel AutoRecover not working, what is next?

## Consider a Scenario

A professional with Windows 10 computer had MS Office 2016 installed on it. For an official purpose, he worked on an Excel workbook and saved it as an XLSX file. After working for hours on it, which was saved with a file name, a power outage occurred in his building for quite some time. After the power was back, he reopened Excel to find a list of recovered files in ‘Document Recovery’ section on the screen’s left side. However, the file that he had worked on recently was the ‘Original version,’ i.e. the last version saved by him and not the auto-saved Excel file. This meant the Excel document did not have any new data that was entered since the last time he saved it. Consequently, he lost hours of work. According to him, this happened despite the fact that the ‘AutoRecover’ feature was enabled. (Still, this needs to be checked and ensured.)

The 'AutoRecover' feature might not work in any of these cases:

- **AutoRecover Feature is disabled -** With this feature disabled, the Excel files are not auto-saved if the document is closed without saving, or the document closes unexpectedly due to an untoward incidence. To check, see if ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto-saved version if I close without saving’ checkboxes are checked or unchecked. If either one is unchecked or both are unchecked, it signifies that the AutoRecover feature is disabled. Else, the AutoRecover is enabled.
- **Corruption in the Excel XLSX file –** If ‘AutoRecover’ is enabled, most probably the cause is ‘damaged Excel XLSX file.’

Before discussing solutions to resolve the ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, let's have an overview of the 'AutoRecover' and 'AutoSave' features.

## A Brief Overview of Excel AutoRecover and AutoSave Feature

AutoRecover is an inbuilt feature in MS Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, 2003, and 2007 that allows saving all of the ‘open Excel files’ at a fixed-interval in a user-specified location or AutoRecover file location. Besides, AutoSave is an add-in that exists in Excel 2002 and earlier versions to save all open Excel files in case of a crash, power outage, or accidental closure of Excel files without saving. Users can recover these files if Excel closes suddenly, for instance, at the time of power outage or failure. The auto-recovered Excel files are saved at a default location.

## Methods to Fix ‘Excel AutoRecover Not Working’ Issue

### Manual Methods

### Method 1 - Enable the 'AutoRecover' Feature if Disabled

Make sure that you have the ‘AutoRecover' feature enabled in your Excel application. If not, follow these steps to enable it:

- Open Excel with MS Excel 2016/2019
- Click on File and then on Options tab
- In ‘Excel Options’, click on Save tab
- Check ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto saved version if I close without saving’ box
- Set the time in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’
- Click on the OK button

Note: With this method, it is not possible to recover data from the current Excel file. From next time onwards, the AutoRecover feature starts working following which Excel shall start auto-saving Excel files as per the time set in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minute’.

### Method 2 - Repair Corrupt Excel File

If corruption in Excel XLSX file has resulted in ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, you will need to [repair Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). Use **‘Open and Repair’** inbuilt utility to fix and repair the damaged (corrupt) Excel file and extract its data. To use the inbuilt utility, execute the following steps:

- Go to location “C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles” to find Excel TMP files and save it as XLSX file

Note: In Windows 8, the location is the same as mentioned above that is for Windows 10. In Windows 7, the location is “C:\\Users\\name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\”

- Open a blank **Excel** sheet; click **File >> Open**
- Go to the location and folder containing the damaged Excel file
- In the **Open** dialog box, choose the damaged Excel file and click the arrow next to the Open button, and then click **Open and Repair**
- In the window that appears, click **Repair** to recover as much data as possible

Now, open the Excel (XLSX) file to check if the Excel file is repaired and its data is recovered.

### Use a Professional Excel File Repair Tool

## How to Fix Excel Formulas Not Working Properly | Step-by-Step Guide

**Summary:** Excel formulas sometimes fail to function correctly and even return an error. This article explains what you might be doing wrong that prevents Excel formulas from working properly and solutions to resolve the issue. If your formulas have disappeared from the Excel spreadsheet and you are having trouble recovering them, you can use an Excel repair tool to recover the formulas.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

When working with Excel formulas, situations may arise when the formula doesn’t calculate or update automatically. Or, you may receive errors by clicking on a formula.

## Problems Causing the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue and Solutions

Let’s check out the possible reasons that cause Excel formulas to work properly and solutions to resolve the issue.

### Problem 1 – Switching Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode

Automatic and manual are the two modes of calculation in Microsoft Excel.

By default, Excel is set to automatic calculation mode. Everything is recalculated automatically when any changes are made in a worksheet in this mode. You may switch from automatic to manual mode to disable the recalculation of formulas, particularly when working with a large Excel file with too many formulas.

Excel will not calculate automatically when set to manual calculation mode. And this may make you think that the Excel formula is not working properly.

### Solution – Change Calculation Mode from Manual to Automatic

To do so, perform these steps:

- Click on the column with problematic formulas.
- Go to the **Formulas** tab, click the **Calculation Options** drop-down, and select **Automatic**.

![Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/switch-manual-to-automatic-calculation-1.png)

### Problem 2 – Missing or Mismatched Parentheses

It’s easy to miss or incorrectly place parentheses or include extra parentheses in a complex formula. If a parenthesis is missing or mismatched and you click Enter after entering a formula, Excel displays a message window suggesting to fix the issue (refer to the screenshot below).

![Missing or Mismatched Parentheses](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/missing-or-mismatched-parantheses-2.png)

Clicking ‘Yes’ might help fix the issue. But Excel might not fix the parentheses properly, as it tends to add the missing parentheses at the end of a formula which won’t always be the case.

### Solution – Check for Visual Cues When Typing or Editing a Formula with Parentheses

When typing a formula or editing one, Excel provides visual cues to determine if there’s an issue with the parentheses inserted in a formula. Checking for these visual cues can help you fix missing/mismatched parentheses.

- Excel helps identify parenthesis pairs by highlighting them in different colors. For instance, the pair of parenthesis outside is black.
- Excel does not make the opening parentheses bold. So, if you’ve inserted the last closing parentheses in a formula, you can determine if your parentheses are mismatched.
- Excel helps identify parentheses pairs by highlighting and formatting them with the same color once you cross over them.

### Problem 3 – Formatting Cells in an Excel Formula

When adding a number in an Excel formula, don’t add any decimal separator or special characters like $ or €. You may use a comma to separate a function’s argument in an Excel formula or use a currency sign like $ or € as part of cell references. Formatting the numbers may prevent the formula from functioning correctly.

### Solution – Use Format Cells Option for Formatting

Use Format Cells instead of using a comma or currency signs for formatting a number in the formula. For instance, rather than entering a value of $10,000 in your formula, insert 10000, and click the ‘Ctrl+1’ keys together to open the Format Cells dialog box.

![Format Cells Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-3-1.png)

### Problem 4 – Formatting Numbers as Text

Numbers are displayed as left-aligned in a sheet in a worksheet, and text formatted numbers are right-aligned in cells. Excel considers numbers formatted as text to be text strings. Thus, it leaves those numbers out of calculations. As a result, a formula won’t work as intended. For example, in the following screenshot, you can see that the SUM formula works correctly for normal numbers. But, when the SUM formula is applied to numbers formatted as text, the formula doesn’t return the correct value.

![Cells Formatted as Text](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cells-formatted-as-text-4.png)

Sometimes, you may also see an apostrophe in the cells or green triangles in the top-left corner of all the cells when numbers in those cells are formatted as Text.

### Solution – Do Not Format Numbers as Text

To fix the issue, do the following:

- Select the cells with numbers stored as text, right-click on them, and click Format Cells.
- From the Format Cells window, click on Number and then press OK.

![Format Cells in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-5.png)

### Problem 5 – Double Quotes to Enclose Numbers

Avoid enclosing numbers in a formula in double-quotes, as the numbers are interpreted as a string value.

Meaning if you enter a formula like =IF(A1>B1, “1”), Excel will consider the output one as a string and not a number. So, you won’t be able to use 1’s in calculations.

### Solution – Don’t Enclose Numbers in Double Quotes

Remove any double quotes around a number in your formula unless you want that number to be treated as text. For example, you can write the formula mentioned above as “1” =IF(A1>B1, 1).

### Problem 6 – Extra Space at Beginning of the Formula

When entering a formula, you may end up adding an extra space before the equal (=) sign. You may also add an apostrophe (‘) in the formula at times. As a result, the calculation won’t be performed and may return an error. This usually happens when you use a formula copied from the web.

### Solution – Remove Extra Space from the Formula

The fix to this issue is pretty simple. You need to look for extra space before the equal sign and remove it. Also, ensure there is an additional apostrophe added in the formula.

## Other Things to Consider to Fix the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue

- If your Excel formula is not showing the result as intended, see this [blog](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
- When you refer to other worksheets with spaces or any non-alphabetical character in their names, enclose the names in ‘single quotation marks’. For example, an external 5reference to cell A2 in a sheet named Data enclose the name in single quotes: **‘Data’!A1**.
- You may see the formula instead of the result if you have accidentally clicked the ‘Show Formulas’ option. So, click on the problematic cell, click on the Formula tab, and then click Show Formulas.
- If you’re getting an error “Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet”, find solutions to fix the error [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

**

The error can occur if the features (Pivot tables, charts, macros) used in the [Excel file get corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). However, there could be several other reasons behind the occurrence of the error. Let’s discuss them.

## **What Causes the "Errors were detected while saving Excel" Error?**

There are various reasons why you encounter this error. Here are some of them:

- Incompatible pivot table in the Excel file
- Large or uncompressed images in the Excel file
- File-sharing properties are not allowing file saving
- Excel file is corrupted
- Large-sized Excel file
- File version incompatibility
- VBA code is corrupted

## **Ways to Fix the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” Error**

You’re not able to save the Excel file if there is no storage space on your hard drive. So, first check if your hard drive has sufficient storage space to save the file. If this is not the case, then it might happen that your antivirus program is interrupting the saving process. To check this, temporarily disable your antivirus program and then try to save the file. If still your Excel is throwing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error, then follow the below given methods to fix the error:

###  **Method 1: Open the Excel in Safe Mode and Disable the Add-ins**

When you open Excel in safe mode, it opens without the third-party add-ins. This helps in finding out if any add-ins are causing the error.

 Here’s how to open the Excel in safe mode:

- Open the Run window by pressing **Windows key + R**.
- Type **excel /safe** in the Run window.  

    ![Excel Save Mode Command](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/excel-save-mode-command.jpg)?

- Next, click on **OK**.
- It will open Excel in safe mode.
- Now, try to open and save the affected file.

If you are able to save the file without any issue, then this means that the error has occurred due to third-party add-ins or settings. You can try disabling the add-ins to fix the issue. To do this, follow these steps:

- First, open Excel.
- Then, go to the **File** tab and click **Options**.

![Go To Options Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/go-to-options-window.jpg)

    ![Add-ins Window](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/add-ins-window.jpg)

**_Note_**_: Disabling add-ins does not remove them from the system. To remove them permanently, you need to uninstall them._

### **Method 2: Check the Excel File Name**

Some users have observed this error when saving the Excel file with an invalid name. You can check the file name and ensure that it should not contain more than 218 characters. If the name exceeds the required limit, then try shortening the file name or move the file to a folder with a short path name.

###  **Method 3: Copy the Data from the Affected File to a New File**

If you are not able to save the Excel document, then try copying the data from the affected file to a new Excel file. Then, save the new file with a different name. This helps in resolving the issue.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide File Permissions**

You may experience the “Errors were detected while saving Excel" issue when you do not have desired permissions to modify the folder in which your Excel file is located. To modify the folder, you should have read, write, and create permissions. You can check and provide the desired permissions using the below steps:

- Right-click on the folder and then choose **Properties**.
- Select the **Security** tab and then click
- Click on **Change Permissions** in the **Advanced Settings**
- Click **Administrators** and then click **Edit**.
- Now set the **Apply to drop-down** button to **This Folder, Subfolder, and Files**.
- Click on the **Full Control** field and then click **Apply > OK**.

###  **Method 5: Check Pivot Tables in Excel Sheet**

You can review Pivot tables to see if they are causing the “Errors were detected while saving Excel” error. To do so, follow the below steps:

- Click **Power Pivot > Manage**.  

    ![Check Pivot Table In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/Repair-Office-Documents/errorsweredetected/check-pivot-table-in-excel.jpg)

- Check the tabs in the **Power Pivot**
- Check if all the formulas used in the table are correct. Sometimes, even a small typo can create an issue in Excel.

## Easy Steps to Make Excel Hyperlinks Working

**Summary:** This blog discusses why hyperlinks won't work in Excel and solutions to fix it. If nothing works, try using Stellar Repair for Excel software to recover your workbook with hyperlinks and all the data intact.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

Hyperlinks in your Excel file could be references to a file’s location on the computer or a location within the same worksheet. Or, hyperlinks might be pointing to a URL. Sometimes, the hyperlinks won’t work and any of the following errors may pop up on your screen on clicking a hyperlink:

**‘Cannot open the specified file.’**

![Cannot open the specified file](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-main-error.png)

‘This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.’

![This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hyperlink-not-working-error-1.png)

## Causes of ‘hyperlinks not working in Excel’ problem, and solutions thereof

Here are some of the possible causes behind the ‘hyperlinks not working’ issue and solutions to fix it:

### Cause 1 – Change in the name of the hyperlinked file

If the file name that appears in the hyperlink text is different than the actual file name, it will prevent the hyperlink from working.

#### Solution – Link to the renamed file

Ensure that the links in the Excel file are updated and points to the renamed file. For this, right-click the hyperlink and select ‘Edit the hyperlink’. Next, in the hyperlink address, replace the current filename with the renamed one in the hyperlink address.

### Cause 2 – File name has a pound (#) sign

When you create a hyperlink for a file in Excel, you cannot use a pound character (#) in the file name that appears in the hyperlink. That is because the pound sign is not accepted in hyperlinks and may lead to the ‘Cannot open the specified file’ error.

**Note:** While you can use a pound character in a file name, it cannot be used in hyperlinks in an MS Office document.  

#### Solution – Rename the file name and remove the pound sign

Open the file that contains the ‘#’ sign and rename it by following these steps.

- Right-click the cell containing the hyperlink that is not working, and click **Edit Hyperlink**.
- From the **Address** box, copy the address of the file you are linking to.
- Go to the location where the file is stored, right-click on the file, and click **Rename**.
- Remove the ‘#’ character from the name of the file.
- Go back to the Excel file, right-click on the problematic hyperlink, and choose **Edit Hyperlink**. Next, browse and select the renamed file.
- The renamed file without the pound sign will be added in the **Address** box.
- Click **OK**.

Now try opening the hyperlink.

### Cause 3 – Sudden system shutdown causes abrupt closing of Excel

There may be a discrepancy in the data in hyperlinks when a system shut down suddenly, without properly closing the Excel file. And so, when trying to open a link, it won’t open.

#### Solution – Enable the option to save hyperlinks

There is an inbuilt option in Excel to update hyperlinks every time the workbook is saved. Follow these steps to enable that option:

**Note:** The steps may vary based on the Excel version you are using.

For Excel 2013, 2016, or 2019:

- Open Excel Workbook -> Go to **File**\->**Options**\->**Advanced**
- Scroll down to find the General tab and click on **Web Options**
- Web Options Window pops-up
- In the Web Options Window, go to **Files** Tab and select the ‘**Update Links on save**‘ checkbox
- Click on **OK** button and your option is saved

The steps are also explained in the image below:

![Select Update links on Save in Web Options window](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Uncheck-the-option-to-save-Hyperlinks.jpg)

For Excel 2007:

- Click the **Office** button
- Select **Excel Options**, then follow Step 1) to Step 5), as mentioned above and get the Excel Hyperlinks to work again.
