## All Things You Need to Know about Wipe Data/Factoy Reset For Itel P55 5G


Wiping data or carrying out a factory reset on an Android device is an effective solution for various issues on your Android phone. Even if you are contemplating selling your phone and you need all your device data to be wiped out, you carry out a factory reset. But, before you proceed, what’s important is to understand about wipe data/ factory reset, because, if you don’t, you might end up losing all your important data before it is backed up, serving no purpose. So, before you wipe data/ factory reset Android, here’s what you should know about it.

## Part 1: What data will be wiped by Wipe Data/Factory Reset?

Doing a factory reset on the Android device will remove all the applications installed on the Itel P55 5G device along with the data associated with them.

![wipe data factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925871266656.jpg)

Since Wipe data/factory reset deletes all applications, app data, and information (documents, videos, images, music, etc) stored in the internal space, it is required for you to perform a [data backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) operation before you reset the Android device to factory settings. However, wipe data/factory reset does not affect the SD card in any way. So, even if you have the SD card inserted with videos, images, documents, and any other personal information in the Android device while carrying out a factory reset, everything will remain safe and intact.

## Part 2: How to perform Wipe Data/ Factory Reset?

Performing [wipe data/factory reset on your Android device](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/)e is very simple. It is a matter of time before you wipe out everything lying on the internal storage of your Android device. Here’s how you can perform Wipe data/ Factory Rest on your device:
