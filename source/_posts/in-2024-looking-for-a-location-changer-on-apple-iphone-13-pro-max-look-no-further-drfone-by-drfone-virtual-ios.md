Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

## Life360: Learn How Everything Works On Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max

Nothing is more important than your mobile device when it comes to your security, privacy, and family. Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.

Whether you're looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you've ever seen.

It's the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it's not the cheapest. So, let's know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.

## Part 1: What Is Life360?

A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one's safety and well-being.

When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members' arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.

Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.

Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.

Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.

Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.

In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user's location on the Life360 website.

## Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?

Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.

The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.

You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.

Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.

## Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?

Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.

According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.

If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app's location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.

You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.

There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.

Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.

Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.

## Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?

What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.

Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) which can help you change your location in real-time.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a comprehensive data management desktop software, which helps you to get all your data in one place and protect your important files from being lost. The software is easy to use and compatible with all Android and iOS devices.

You can also remotely wipe sensitive data and settings from any device at any time. With this software, you can backup your contacts, messages, photos, videos, call history, etc., to your PC or to the cloud service. All these features come as part of this.

Setting a virtual location is one of the prime role Dr.Fone plays.

![tap on move here button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

## Part 6: FAQs

### 1\. What are Life360 events?

Although Life360 events are a great way to keep your loved ones informed about your whereabouts, they also provide information about your location, like the weather, time, and date. You can even set an alert when you arrive at a specific location.

For example, if you want to see who is at your house, you can set an event to notify you when someone enters or leaves your home.

### 2\. What does protecting a drive on Life360 do?

Improve your family's driving habits by getting a weekly picture of everyone's driving habits. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the driving patterns of every member of the Circle.

Find out about things like your highest speed and whether or not you text while driving, among other things. Then, take a look at individual drives to find out details such as the exact route taken, the number of kilometers recorded, the peak speed, driving style, and the locations of any driving incidents.

When Circle members are on the road, whether driving, using public transportation, or traveling with companions, keep an eye on their peak speed.

### 3\. Why does life360 show walking instead of driving?

In brief, it is because walking is less likely to be used for commuting than driving. For example, if you live in a rural area, you may not have access to public transportation, and therefore, you would have to walk to work.

### 4\. What does it mean when life360 doesn't update?

It means that the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device you're using is not connected to the internet. In this case, you should check if your internet connection is working properly. If you're sure your internet connection is working fine, try restarting your device.

### 5\. Does Life360 work when your phone is off?

In the event that you switch off your phone, the GPS feature will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your phone is turned off.

However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data uploaded to your account. So, a life360 login online is necessary.

## Conclusion

Life360 is a useful application that helps you keep tabs on your loved ones. You can track location, receive notifications, and get alerts. But if you want to fake your location, [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is the most recommended product because of its unique features and easy-to-use interface.
