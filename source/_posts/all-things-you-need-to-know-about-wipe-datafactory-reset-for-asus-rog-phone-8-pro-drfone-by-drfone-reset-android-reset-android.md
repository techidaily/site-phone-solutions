- **Step 1: Find the Reset pinhole.**

Look for a very small opening on the back panel or the bezels of a smartphone. Usually, such pinholes are marked “Reset” or “Reboot” and are available on the top left side of the back panel. But be careful not to mistake it with the microphone as using it for resetting your gadget may damage the small microphone permanently and lead to other complications.

- **Step 2: Insert a pin into the hole.**

After locating it, insert a stretched paperclip or a small pin into the hole and press it for a few seconds.

Now all the data in your Android device will be reset. After this, you can continue to use your device normally without any problem.

## Part 4: Reset Android from Settings (phone works normally)

If your Android tablet or smartphone is functioning normally, your device can be reset to the factory settings using just your device itself. Even if your device does not have a home button or volume control buttons, this method will be applicable and can be used to reset the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device. But before using this method to reset your Android device, make sure to back up all the necessary information that you have on your device. You can also sync all the important files to the cloud using your Google account. Also, it is necessary to keep in mind that this procedure will remove all the accounts into which your device is signed in. To know how to reset an Android tablet without volume button, read on.

- **Step 1: Open the Settings app.**

Tap on the Settings app in the app section of your device to open it.

- **Step 2: Select the Data Reset folder.**

After that, navigate or scroll down until you can find the “Backup and Reset” option. Tap on it to open the folder.

## Conclusion

So these are the methods with which you can do a reset without using volume buttons. The difficulty level of the methods depends on the type and brand of the Android device. The first two parts can be performed easily by anyone, and that too in a matter of a few minutes. However, the third method may pose some difficulty, particularly because manufacturers set different key combinations for rebooting the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device into recovery. Nevertheless, once it is figured out, the rest is easy. Hence, it is up to you to decide on the method to be adopted for hard resetting your Android device.
