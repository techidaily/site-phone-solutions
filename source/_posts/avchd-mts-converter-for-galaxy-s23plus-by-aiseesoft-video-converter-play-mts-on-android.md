    Wanna watch MTS clips copied from your AVCHD camera on Samsung Galaxy S23+? AVCHD is a popular file-based format for digital recording and playback of high-definition video. Most Android phones or tablets lack native support for AVCHD MTS footage. You can either use a third party media player like VLC or MX player to play MTS files on your Samsung Galaxy S23+, or convert AVCHD footage to MP4 format that is well compatible with Samsung Galaxy S23+.
