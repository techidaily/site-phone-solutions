  Since Samsung Galaxy A34 5G does not support playback of .MOV files using its stock player, you will need to install a third party media player that supports QuickTime MOV, or process file conversion before the playback. To download a .mov player for your Samsung Galaxy A34 5G, you can give VLC player, MX Player, BS Player and Mobo player a shot. To convert MOV files for viewing on Samsung Galaxy A34 5G, you can give Video Converter a shot. You load your MOV files to this Converter app, and choose H.264 MP4 as output format.
