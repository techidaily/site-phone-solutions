      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Motorola G24 Power, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Motorola G24 Power cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Motorola G24 Power would be a workable solution.

    My Motorola G24 Power won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a Motorola G24 Power which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my Motorola G24 Power? I would really appreciate any help."
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
    This is probably because your Motorola G24 Power doesn’t have enough power to handle 4K HEVC files. In this situation, we would recommend converting them to a format that is well supported by your Motorola G24 Power first.
