## Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On HTC U23?

Pokémon Go is the phenomenon that hit us in 2016 and made us obsessed with the AR game based on real-time location. If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.

![pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg)

Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of "catching them all."

'Spoofing' location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you're in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.

## **Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?**

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo's Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.

So, ****is PGSharp legal?**** No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.

 According to Niantic's terms and conditions:

- "Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device's location (for example through GPS spoofing).
- And _"_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software)."

 If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.

- The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.
- The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.
- The third strike will permanently ban your account.

 You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you've been banned without violation of any terms.

## ****Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android****

1. **PGSharp :**

![pgsharp-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg)

PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.

****Note:**** It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.

- To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google's "Play store," search "PGSharp," and install it.
- After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.
- For the paid key, visit PGSharp's official website and generate a license key.

You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an "out of stock." message.

- After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.

****Note:**** You may need to allow "Mock location" from debugging options. For this, go to "Settings," then to "About Phone," then you need to tap on "Build number" seven times to enable developer's mode, and finally go to "Debugging" to allow "Mock location."

2. ****Fake GPS Go:****

![fake gps go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg)

Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world. This is one of the easiest solutions to playing Pokémon   Go while spoofing location without getting detected with its real-map-like UI. Moreover, this app does not even require root access.

- To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google's "Play store," search "Fake GPS Go," and install it.
- Then, go to your phone's "Settings" and then "System" followed by "About Phone," and tap on the "Build Number" 7 times to enable the Developer Options.
- Then you need to go to "Debugging" in "Developers Options" to allow "Mock location."
- And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.

3. **VPN:**

![vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg)

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.

Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.

- To install a VPN, go to Google's "Play store," search the VPN of your choice and install it.
- Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.
- Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.

****Note:**** Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data. Hence, selecting a good VPN app is imperative, which will spoof GPS location and data encryption.

You can use both VPNs (which do not spoof GPS location themselves) and the Fake location app simultaneously for extra reliability.

## ****Part 3: Best way to spoof on iOS – dr.fone Virtual Location****

Spoofing the GPS location on iPhones is more difficult and much more complex than it is on Android. However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.

Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select "Virtual Location" given on the first page of the program.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select "Get Started". Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Step 3: Enable the "teleport mode" by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone's GPS to in the text box in the map's left-upper section. Select "Go".

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Step 4: Now select "Move here." And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

****Pro-Tips:****

- Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.
- Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.
- Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)
- After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.
- Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.
- Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.

Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who's on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.

## Best 10 Mock Location Apps Worth Trying On HTC U23

Location-based apps and games are all the rage right now, and the latest trends indicate that this is not going anywhere but upwards. When you want to access content that is not available to you in your current location, what can you do? Or, when you want to catch Pokémon but aren’t getting any, you can’t give up and stop playing, can you? A location spoofer app to mock location can help you in this situation, and we are going to tell you how to mock location on iPhone and Android along with the top **mock location apps** for Android and iPhone in this guide. Read on!

![top mock location apps for android ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-1.jpg)

## Part I: Purpose of Mock Location Apps

The sole purpose of mock location apps or software is to help users spoof/ mock location to somewhere they are physically not. This may or may not be illegal/ immoral depending on how you use the apps, but who are we to judge! We are here to simply help you with the process.

- Prank your friends and family by showing your location in some other country and have some healthy laughs at their expense!
- Access geographically restricted content such as on streaming platforms. Mocking your location to somewhere where your favorite shows and movies are available helps you watch them from the comfort of your home, wherever in the world that may be!
- If you are an avid Snapchat user, certain filters are only available in certain locations, and you can mock location on iPhone or Android to avail of them.
- Location-based games such as Pokémon GO derive the most benefit from a mock location app because you can change your location and show yourself walking in the streets of London while sipping a mojito at a beach in Hawaii and catching amazing new Pokémon!
- In dating apps, why pay a fee to unlock worldwide access when you can simply use a mock location app to let the dating app change your current location automatically in accordance with your selection in the location spoofer app on your Android or iPhone?

## Part II: Is It Safe to Mock Location? Can It Be Detected?

One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.

Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.

## Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone

There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple's strict policies on user privacy and security. Apple prioritizes maintaining a secure and reliable user experience, which limits the availability of apps that could potentially misuse location data. Therefore, this part will mainly introduce five softwares that need to be installed on a computer. Let’s come to the apps! Here are the top location spoofer apps for iPhone.

When in doubt, trust Wondershare’s Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to do the job reliably and professionally in just a few clicks.

A quality product from Wootechy, iMoveGo is compatible with the latest iOS 17 and works well for what it does. It does not require jailbreak and comes with a trial version you can use to see what it does and if it fits your purpose.

#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.



## Part IV: Top Mock Location Apps for Android

Now for the top location spoofer apps on Android OS! Some from above are also compatible with and fully support Android going up to version 14, so you might see duplicates.

#### 1\. GPS Emulator

iToolab AnyGo for Android works in over 100 games and apps and can simulate movements between two points. The speed of movement can be customized and the app does not require you to root your HTC U23.

#### 4\. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

![drfone virtual location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-android.jpg)

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world.

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Closing Words

Using a mock location app can be fun. You can use it for recreational purposes such as pranking friends. You can use it for practical purposes such as saving money on dating apps by mocking location on Android and iPhones to anywhere around the world to meet new people. You can use it to simulate movement anywhere in the world in location-based games. You can also use mock location apps to effectively change your geographical location to watch content not available in your true geographical area. Whatever your reason may be, what you need is a reliable mock location app so that you can spoof your location undetected. Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is one such app you can trust with your eyes closed.

## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On HTC U23?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the HTC U23 devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your HTC U23** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on HTC U23s?

To hide the location on your HTC U23 and iPad, below listed are the steps.

**Step 1**. Open the Control Center on your iDevice, iPhone 13 for example. (For iPhone X and above models, swipe down from the top-right, while on other devices, swipe from the bottom of the screen)

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the HTC U23 devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

### 3.2. How to stop GPS tracking on Android Devices?

The process to turn off GPS location on Android devices may vary from device to device and brand to brand. Still, the commonly used steps for turning off the location are listed below.

**Step 1**. On your HTC U23, swipe down on your screen to open the options list.

![switch off gps on android devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-android-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Search for the Airplane icon and click on it to turn on the Airplane Mode.

**Step 3**. Next, open the App Drawer and then choose Settings > Location. Turn off the Location.

![drfone virtual location switch off gps on android devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-android-2.jpg)

## Part 4: Spoof Location to prevent GPS Tracing without Turning on Airplane Mode

![virtual location map interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 5**. Next, in the upper-right corner, click on the teleport mode icon. Next, enter the desired location at the upper left-hand side that you wish to teleport to. Finally, click on the **Go** button after entering the site.

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the HTC U23 device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the HTC U23 device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.
