This blog discusses the possible reasons for data disappearance and the solutions to fix the issue. Also, it mentions an Excel file repair tool to retrieve the data from the file.

## **Probable Reasons for Data Disappearing in MS Excel and Solutions Thereof**

### Reason 1 – Unsaved Data

While entering data in an Excel spreadsheet, it is important to save the data at frequent intervals. Doing so prevents any unsaved data from disappearing if you lose power or accidentally click ‘No’ when prompted to save the file. Unfortunately, such a situation is quite common as users often close the file without saving the recently made changes to a spreadsheet.

### Solution – Use the ‘AutoSave’ Feature

With the AutoSave feature enabled in Excel, data won’t be lost in the event of power failure or abruptly closing the Excel program. By default, Excel automatically saves the information in a spreadsheet after every 10 minutes. You can reduce the limit to a few seconds to reduce the chances of Excel file data lost after being saved.

![Change excel autosave internal](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/change-excel-autosave-interval-img-1-1.png)

### Reason 2 – Changing Excel Format

You can save an Excel file in various formats, like spreadsheet, text, webpage, and more. However, at times, saving the spreadsheet in a different format may lead to missing data. For example, when you save a workbook to a text file format, all formulas and calculations applied to the data will be lost.

### Solution – Adjust a Spreadsheet for the Changed Format 

If you’re changing the format of a spreadsheet, make space for the rows and columns. Also, remove all calculations before saving the file.

**Note:** If the sheet is shared on multiple computers, then save the file in compatibility mode.

### Reason 3 – Merging Cells

You can combine two or more cells data to make one large cell. This technique is primarily used to fit the text of a title in a sheet. If there is data in two or more cells, then only the data in the top-left cell is displayed and the data in all other cells is deleted. If the other merged cells have been populated with data after merging, the data is not featured and it does not appear even after remerging the cells.

### Solution – Merge Cells inside One Column

To merge cells without data loss, combine all the cells you want to merge within a column and do the following:

-   Select the cells to be combined.
-   Ensure that column width is wide enough to fit the contents of a cell.
-   In the spreadsheet, under the Editing group, click ‘Fill,’ and then click ‘Justify.’

![excel-fill-option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/excel-fill-option-img-2-1-1024x253.png)

-   Under Alignment, click on the ‘Merge & Center’ option to center align the text. Or, click on ‘Merge Cells’.

**Note:** This solution works for text only. You cannot use it to merge formulas or any numerical values. If you need to combine two or more cells with formula into a single cell, try using the [Excel CONCAT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/combine-text-from-two-or-more-cells-into-one-cell-81ba0946-ce78-42ed-b3c3-21340eb164a6).

### Reason 4 – Cell Formatting

Cells and text in the cells can be displayed in different colors to make the spreadsheet simple to create and infer. You may experience data loss when you try to modify the data or change the color or size of the data. Though the information may exist, the data may show an error due to the following reasons:  

-   White-colored text will not show in a white-colored cell
-   Large font-sized data may not appear in small-sized cell
-   Calculations may show (#VALUE) error after cell-formatting

### Solution – Check and Clear Formatting

Make sure to use dark-colored text on a white-colored cell. Also, resize the cell to fit the text size. Check if numbers in a cell are entered as text. If so, you need to apply a number format to the text-formatted numbers. Read more about it, from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/fix-text-formatted-numbers-by-applying-a-number-format-6599c03a-954d-4d83-b78a-23af2c8845d0).

## What Else You Can Do to Resolve the ‘Excel Data Disappeared’ Issue?

If you can’t recover the missing Excel file data, try to repair or extract the data from the file using the built-in **Excel repair tool**. Follow the below steps to use the tool:

Sometimes, the error can occur if the file in which you are trying to insert the object is locked and password-protected. In this case, you can [unprotect the Excel file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/protect-a-worksheet-3179efdb-1285-4d49-a9c3-f4ca36276de6). If the issue still persists, then you can follow the below methods.

"Excel was able to open the file by repairing or removing the unreadable content. Excel recovered your formulas and cell values, but

## Workarounds to Resolve the 'Excel found unreadable content in filename.xls' Error

There is no permanent solution to fix the 'Excel found unreadable content' error. But, following are some workarounds you can try to resolve the error.

**_Note:_** _Before you try any of these workarounds, run Excel with administrator privileges and try opening the Excel file that is throwing the 'unreadable content' error. If this doesn't fix the error, proceed with the workarounds below._

### **Workaround 1 – Try Opening the File in Excel 2003**

Sometimes a problem in the current Excel version might prevent a file from opening. To resolve this error, try opening the problematic file in Excel 2003. If the file opens, save the data in a web page file format (.html) and then try opening the .html file in MS Excel 2010/2007. The detailed step-wise instructions are as follows:

- Open the .xls file in Excel 2003.
- When the file opens, click on File > Save.
- In the 'Save As' dialog box, choose Web Page (.html) as the 'Save as type' and then click 'Save.' Doing so will save everything from your .xls file, opened with 2003, in .html file format.
- Open the .html file in Excel 2010/2007. And then, save the file with .xlsx extension with a new name to avoid overwriting the original file.

Now, open the Excel 2010/2007 file and check if the error is fixed. If not, use the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Make the Excel File 'Read-only'**

Try to open your '.xlsx' file by making it 'read-only'. Follow these steps:

- In Excel, click 'File' from the main menu.
- Select 'Save' for a new document or 'Save As' for a previously saved document in the screen that appears.

![Excel File Saving Options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Excel-file-saving-options-image-3.png)

- From the 'Save As' dialog box, click Tools > General Options.

![Open General Options In Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Open-general-options-in-excel-image-4.png)

- Click on the 'Read-only recommended' checkbox to make the document read-only and then click 'OK'.

![Select Read Only Recommended Option](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Select-read-only-recommended-option-image-5.png)

Now open a new '.xlsx' file and copy everything from the corrupt Excel file to this new file. Finally, save this file and try to open it again.

### **Workaround 3 – Move Excel File to a New Folder**

Some users have reported that they could open their Excel file, following the 'Excel unreadable content' error, by simply moving the file to a different folder and saving it under a new name. You can also move the affected file to a new folder and try opening it. If this didn't help resolve the error, follow the next workaround.

### **Workaround 4 – Install Visual Basic Component**

At times, it is seen that installing the 'Visual Basic' component of MS Office 2010 resolves the 'Excel found unreadable content 2010' error. To do so, follow these steps:

- Navigate to Control Panel > Programs and select Microsoft Office 2010.
- Click 'Change' and then select 'Add or Remove Programs'.
- Next, click the 'plus' sign provided next to Office Shared Features.
- Click 'Visual Basic for Applications'. After that, right-click and choose 'Run from My Computer' and hit the 'Continue' button.
