This article has discussed the Mobile Legends game and how you can **fake GPS Mobile Legends.** Usually, people like to hide their locations or fake them because they prefer their privacy and don't want to be located by their friends or family. However, in the case of Mobile Legends, people spoof their location to increase their rank or get new challenges. Therefore, we have given you a clear idea of how you can fake your location using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on both Android and iOS devices.
