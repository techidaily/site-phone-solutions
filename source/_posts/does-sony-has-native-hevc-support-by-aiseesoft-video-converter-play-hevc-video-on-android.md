    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Sony Xperia 1 V and it failed terribly. Does Sony Xperia 1 V come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Sony Xperia 1 V on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
