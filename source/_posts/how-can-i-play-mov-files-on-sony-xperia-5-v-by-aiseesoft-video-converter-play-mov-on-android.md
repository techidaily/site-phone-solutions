  “Hi guys, I just changed for the Sony Xperia 5 V about half a month ago and I'm very pleased with it and don't regret leaving Apple, saving for iTunes compatibility. Anyways can anyone please tell me if there's a way I could play my .mov videos taken with my old iPhone on my Sony Xperia 5 V? Thanks.”

  Since Sony Xperia 5 V does not support playback of .MOV files using its stock player, you will need to install a third party media player that supports QuickTime MOV, or process file conversion before the playback. To download a .mov player for your Sony Xperia 5 V, you can give VLC player, MX Player, BS Player and Mobo player a shot. To convert MOV files for viewing on Sony Xperia 5 V, you can give Video Converter a shot. You load your MOV files to this Converter app, and choose H.264 MP4 as output format. This will ensure the converted files have a good playback performance on your Sony Xperia 5 V.
