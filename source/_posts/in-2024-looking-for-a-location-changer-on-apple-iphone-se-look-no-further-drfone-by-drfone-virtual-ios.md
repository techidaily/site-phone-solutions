Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Apple iPhone SE. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Apple iPhone SE app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

### Part 2: Movement Simulation Between two Places

Step 1: Launch the tool and look for the first icon at the upper right screen which is “one-stop route”. Choose the place you want to travel on the map. You will know the distance in the pop-up box.

Step 2: The slider located below the screen needs to be dragged to set the speed of travelling. You can choose cycling speed or the speed you want. Hit on “Move Here” afterwards.

Step 3: Next, key in a number that will define the number of times you want to travel the route back and forth. Hit “March” option.

![define the number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

Step 4: Now, the position will be seen moving as per the chosen speed on the map. And this is how you can fake the movement sans **_Fake GPS Go apk_**.

### Part 3: Simulate Route Movement for Multiple Locations

Step 1: For multiple spots, you need to click the “multi-stop route” after entering map interface. This mode is the second icon on the upper right side. Now, select the multiple places one by one where you want to pass.

Step 2: The pop-up will show the distance where you need to hit the “Move Here” button. Choose the moving speed.

![select the multiple places](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 3: Enter a digit for how many times you want to take route and click “March”. This will begin the movement simulation.
