## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Itel S23+

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.

## Part 6: How to Delete/Leave a Life360 Circle?

Getting rid of a Circle is a cinch! To begin, you need to:

## How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Itel S23+?

Life360 is an online platform that utilizes geo-location services to help users share their real-time location with friends and family. The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.

As of now, you cannot run **_Life360 on computer_** as it is only available for Android and iOS. _Why?_ Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.

However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the **_Life360 app for Windows_**. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the **_Life360 app on Windows_**.

So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.

## Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?

First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get **_Life360 for PC_**. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.

In this situation, you can simply run the **_Life360 app on PC_**. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.

Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.

## Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?

Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.

The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.

However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and **_run the app on a Windows PC_**. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.

These methods include:

## Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator

The first and the most convenient way to run **_Life360 on computer_** is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.

While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.

Here’s how you can run **_Life360 on a computer_** using Bluestacks Android emulator./

Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.

Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button. This will initiate the download process on your System.

![bluestacks 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-1.jpg)

Step 3: Once the installation process completes, Bluestacks will start to boot. Keep in mind that the first boot may take some time, depending on your system configurations.

![bluestacks 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-2.jpg)

Step 4: In the home screen, tap the “Google Play Store” icon. You’ll be asked to sign-in with your Google account. Enter the right credentials and log-in to the Google Play Store.

![bluestacks 13](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-3.jpg)

Step 5: In the top search bar, type-in Life360 and tap the “install” button to download the app.

![bluestacks 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-4.jpg)

Step 6: Life360 is now installed on your computer. Open the app and enter your login details. You’ll now be able to run Life360 on your PC.

![bluestacks 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/bluestacks-5.jpg)

## Part 4: Use Life360 by mirroring Android to Windows PC

While running an emulator is a great way to get **_Life360 on PC_,** it has its own set of challenges. For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.

In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run **_Life360 on PC_**. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.

Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.

Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.

Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.

![mirroring android 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg)

Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.

![mirroring android 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg)

Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.

![mirroring android 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg)

Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.

![mirroring android 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg)

Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer. Any action that you perform on your device will be replicated on your computer screen as well.

## Final Verdict

Life360 is probably among the top family locators for Android users. Apart from its extensive range of features, the app provides a user-friendly interface, which allows it easier for even elders to use the app without any issues. Even though there isn’t a dedicated Life360 software for Windows, you can follow the above-mentioned methods to run the **_Life360 on PC_**.

## How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Itel S23+?

When you are playing location-based games like Pokemon Go, you might need to simulate GPS movement to catch more Pokemon. To do this, you can use the GPS movement feature of Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). This feature allows you to simulate GPS movement between two or multiple spots on the map. Here's how you can do it:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

### Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)

You can set up a one-stop route when **mocking locations fake** with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This particular feature helps users to set up looping or round trips within a specific location. To perform the steps for simulating movement, look ahead for a better understanding:

Step 1Access One-Stop Route Function

Once you launch Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and connect your smartphone successfully, proceed to select the **One-Stop Route** function from the top-right section. The function is represented by the third icon from the left in the section. While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.

![activate one stop route mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 2Define Simulation Parameters

Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a **Round trip** or a **Loop trip**. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click **Move Here** on the bottom to start the movement simulation.

![set parameters to simulate](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

Step 3Start Simulation Movement

The respective simulation starts, and you can see your position is moving on the map with the speed you set. If you wish to hold the simulation, click **Pause** or tap **Clear** to revert to your original state.

![start one stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

### Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android/**iOS:

Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters

Activate the **Multi-Stop Route** mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click **Start Moving** to initiate the process.

**Note:** Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.

![activate multi stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement

As the simulation starts, click **Pause** at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also **Clear** all settings if required.

![execute multi stop route simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

### Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)

Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.

![try joystick movement for simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png)

The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.
