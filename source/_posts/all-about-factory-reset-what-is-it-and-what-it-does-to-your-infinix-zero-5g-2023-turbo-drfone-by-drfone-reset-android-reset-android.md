**Step 1:** Directly go to the [Android Device Manager website](https://www.google.com/android/find/), and log in to your account. You will get three options: "Play Sound", "Secure Device" and "Erase Device".

**Step 2:** Click on the "Play Sound" option will make it raise the alarm, notifying of the location, you can easily locate your Android phone if it is nearby.

**Step 3:** Click "Secure Device", you can remotely lock your device with a new passcode, display a custom message on the lock screen, and even track the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device's location in real-time. It also gives you the option to add a contact number, so anyone who finds your device can reach out to you.

**Step 4:** Select "Erase Device" to reset your device. Once you select this option, the interface will take over and complete the job. Congratulations! You have successfully used the Android Device Manager (ADM) to reset your Android smartphone.

## The Bottom Line

So these were the third different methods through which you can hard reset your Android device. Resetting the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device involves removing every data from the Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo device. The phone gets back to the same state as it was out of the box. Hence, most importantly, do not forget to back up data using Phone Backup and restore beforehand so that you do not end up losing anything important.
