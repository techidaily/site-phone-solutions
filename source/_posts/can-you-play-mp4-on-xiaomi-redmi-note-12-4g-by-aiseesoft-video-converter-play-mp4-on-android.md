  “Hi, any ideas why my Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G doesn't play MP4 videos. I've copied several MP4 clips onto my SD card. It turns up in the media player app. But when I go to play it a popup message saying something like ‘this video cannot be played’. Strangely I earlier put an AVI video onto the same SD card. I can play this AVI video fine in the same video player app. MP4 should be playable on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G. Why did this happen? Is there anything I can do to solve the issue? Thanks for any help.”
