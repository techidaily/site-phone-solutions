You can encounter the **“File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe”** error when the Excel application detects any issue with the file. This happens when you try to open an old version file format in a newer version or if the file is received from an unsafe destination. This can prevent you from opening the Excel file.

**As indicated from the error message, this error occurs due to the following reasons:**

- The file has incorrect file extension.
- The file is corrupted.
- The file you are trying to open is protected.

Now, let’s see how to resolve this Excel error.

## **Methods to Fix the “File format and extension of \[filename\] don’t match” Error**

Try the following methods to troubleshoot the “File format and extension don’t match” error in Excel.

### **Method 1: Rename the Excel File**

You can face the “File format and extension don’t match” issue if the file has incorrect extension. It can occur if the file extension has been altered or you’ve mistakenly saved the file with incorrect extension. To fix this, you can try renaming the Excel file with the correct file extension.  

### **Method 2: Check the Default Excel File Format**

Different versions of Microsoft Excel use different default file formats. For example, .xls is the default file format of older versions (2003 and lower) of Excel, whereas .xlsx format is used by the newer versions (2007 and later). Opening the Excel file with an incompatible extension can cause the “File format and extension don’t match” issue. You can check the Excel version you are using and ensure it’s compatible with the Excel file you are trying to open.

### **Method 3: Change the Protected View Settings**

You may receive the “**File format and extension of excel don’t match**” error if the Excel file is protected. You can check and try disabling the [Protected View settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653).  

**Caution:** Changing the Protected View settings can put your system at risk. If the Excel file is being downloaded from the internet, it may contain viruses that can infect your system. So be careful before disabling the Protected View settings.

### **Steps to Change Protected View Settings in Excel:**

- In the Excel’s File menu, click on **Options.**
- Select **Trust Center > Trust Center Settings**.

![Go to Trust Center and then click Trust center settings.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-to-trust-center-and-then-trust-center-settings.jpg)

- Under **Trust Center**, select **Protected View** and disable the below three options:

- Click **OK.** Then, try to open the Excel file.

### **Method 4: Check and Provide the Excel File Permissions**

- Locate the affected Excel file, right-click on it, and select **Properties.**

## Repair Office 2016 Files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)on Windows

If you frequently work with Microsoft Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files, then issues like file inaccessibility or corruption won’t be new to you.

Let’s discuss some common scenarios which may lead to corrupt MS Office 2016 files:  

## Scenarios behind Microsoft Office Files Corruption

### Scenario 1 – Disruption during Data Migration

You decide to move Office files from your hard drive to other removable media. However, when you try to access the data within the files post-migration, you may find Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files showing gibberish characters. Due to a power surge, sudden system shutdown, and internal mechanical failure, the files may have turned corrupt.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/Word-displaying-gibberish-characters.png)

Figure 1- Microsoft Word file showing garbage characters

### Scenario 2 – Office Files and Registry Entries Become Infected

When you open or use the Microsoft Office application, it crashes as soon as it opens. You assume that an add-in was causing the problem and restart the Office application without add-ins loaded, but the application still crashes. This may happen because of a virus infecting the Office files and registry values, thus leading to corrupt or damaged Office files.

### **Scenario 3 – Inaccessible or Lost Data**

Suppose all your Office files are stored on a USB device, and you unplugged the device while it was still open in Windows. Now, when you attempt to open a Word or an Excel file, all the data is gone. Unsafe removal of USB or any other external storage device may corrupt the data inside your Office files or turn the file inaccessible.

## Fix the Too many different cell formats Error in Excel?

Excel has set a limit on the number of unique cell formats within a workbook. Excel 2003 allows up to 4000 different cell format combinations, whereas Excel 2007 and later versions allow a maximum of 64000 combinations. When this limit exceeds, you may encounter errors, such as “Too many different cell formats”. It can prevent you from inserting or modifying workbook rows or columns. Sometimes, it prevents you to copy and paste the content within the same or different workbooks.  This error may also occur due to various other reasons.

You can encounter the “Too many different cell formats” error due to the below reasons:

- Formatting is missing in the workbook.
- Size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive use of complex formatting (conditional formatting).
- Workbook contains a large number of merged cells.
- There are multiple built-in or custom cell styles.
- Excel workbook is corrupted.
- The unused styles are unexpectedly copied to new workbooks (when moving or copying a worksheet from one to another).
- Workbooks contain multiple worksheets with different cell formatting.

## **Methods to Fix the “Too many different cell formats” Error in Excel**

First, check that your Excel application is up-to-date. It helps in preventing duplicate styles in workbooks. If the error persists, then follow the below methods:

### **Method 1: Simplify the Workbook Formatting**

You can face the error in Excel - Too many different cell formats, if the size of your Excel file has increased due to excessive or unnecessary formatting. You can try to simplify the formatting of the affected workbook. While reducing the number of formatting combinations, you can follow the simplifying guidelines, such as using a standard font and applying borders consistently. Follow the below steps to remove unnecessary formatting in your worksheet:

- First, open the affected worksheet.
- Now, use the shortcut key (Ctrl+A) to select all the cells.
- In the Excel ribbon, navigate to the **Home** tab and click **Clear**.

![Clicking Clear in the Home tab of the Excel ribbon](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-excel-home-click-clear.jpg)

- Then, select the **Clear Formats** option.

![Choosing Clear Formats from the available options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/select-clear-formats-option.jpg)

### **Method 2: Remove Conditional Formatting**

Conditional formatting is also one of the reasons behind the “Too many different cell formats” error. It usually occurs if you have applied multiple rules to various cells or cell ranges within a workbook. Each rule has its own formatting settings.

## Solutions to Restore Excel File

Below we have discussed various solutions to repair, recover, and restore unsaved, lost, corrupt, or inaccessible Excel files with the help of MS Excel options and Excel repair software.

**_NOTE:_** _Some of these methods work only if you had enabled or configured certain required settings or options before corruption or losing the Excel file._

### 1\. Restore Lost or Unsaved Excel File via ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks’ Option

The _Recover Unsaved Workbooks_ option allows you to restore the Excel file that you forgot to save before closing MS Excel or it stopped working. The steps are as follows:

- Navigate to ‘_File > Open._’
- Scroll to the bottom and click on ‘Recover Unsaved Workbooks.’ This opens a File Explorer browser window.

- Now look for the Excel file that you lost and then double-click on it to open and restore the Excel file.
- Once the file is open, click on **File > Save As** and save it to your desired location.

![change excel settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/change-settings-excel.png)

### 2\. Repair and Restore Corrupt or Inaccessible Excel File

If the Excel file you are trying to open or access is corrupt, MS Excel will display an error message. When MS Excel detects corruption, it starts ‘File Recovery Mode’ to repair the Excel workbook.

However, if it doesn’t start automatically, you can manually repair minor corruption error and restore the Excel file by following these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Open** and then navigate to the corrupt or damaged Excel file location.
- Select the file and then click on the arrow beside the ‘**Open**’ button to choose the **‘Open and Repair…**’ option.

![open and repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/open-and-repair-excel-file.png)

![repair corrupt excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Excel-repair/repair-corrupt-excel-sheet.png)

If the ‘**Repair’** option fails, use the Extract Data option that extracts values, data, and formulas from the Excel workbook.

### 3\. Revert Excel File to Last Saved Version

When an Excel file gets corrupt or damaged while working, you may revert the Excel file to the last saved version. This allows you to restore the Excel file version that isn’t corrupt or damaged. The steps are as follows,

- Click File > Open.

The workbook opens without any changes you’ve made that might have caused the workbook to become corrupted.
