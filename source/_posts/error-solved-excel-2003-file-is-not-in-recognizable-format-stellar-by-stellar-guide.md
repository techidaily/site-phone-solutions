## How to Fix a Corrupted .xls File? The Everything Guide

Undoubtedly, Excel is so powerful that it can help you to process, analysis, and store data, in masses.

That’s the reason it has been there for years and helping this world in data.

But…

With all those powers comes some nasty problems which no Excel users like to face. Can you guess what I’m talking about?

Think about a Corrupted Excel File. Nightmare? Isn’t it?

And do you remember that last time when you have opened a workbook and you got a message that this workbook is might corrupt?

The TRUTH is, this is something which you cannot avoid, but, you can [prepare yourself in the best way](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) and deal with it like a PRO.

So today, in this post, I’d like to share with you to everything you need to know about a corrupt Excel file (.xls), why it happens, how to fix it like a PRO, and much more.

...let’s get started.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/introduction.jpg)

**Note**: In this post, we’ll be covering the .xls version (which is the extension for the file which is created in Excel 2007 or the earlier versions) and if you want to know about the new version, [here’s the quick fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) for that.

## Why My Excel File Got Corrupted?

There can be one or multiple reasons for an Excel file to get corrupted. Below I have detailed about some of the major of them.

### 1\. Large Excel File

You can store data in a workbook the way you want but sometimes using excessive thing can make an Excel file bigger in size.

And that kind of data files can crash at any point in time. Here are a few things which make the Excel files heavy, like

- Conditional Formatting.
- Colors formatting.
- Using merged cells in place of text alignment.
- Volatile functions: Formulae that iterate every time you open or change a cell value; OFFSET, NOW.
- Using a complete column or row as a reference than the data set range.
- Using complex formulas; VLOOKUP in place of Index/Match, Nested If in place of MAXIFS, MINIFS.
- Calculations or reference across workbooks.

**Related:** [How to Fix Formatting Issues in Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)

### 2\. Abrupt System Shutdown

Shutting down the system without following the procedure can corrupt your data file.

This shut down can be due to a power failure or any other unexpected technical challenges.

So it is always important to follow the procedures and shut down your system properly to avoid data losses.

### 3\. Infected Excel File (Virus Attack)

This is the most common and obvious reason for Excel file corruption.

Although we always keep our system safe using various Antiviruses, still there is always a probability of virus attacks and loss of important files.

It is always advised to use a safe and strong antivirus compatible with your system requirements.

## What are the Signs to Know When an Excel File is Corrupted?

In this section, we will discuss what are the signs which you can get when an Excel file is corrupted, let’s dig into it.

### 1\. The File is Corrupt and Cannot Be Opened

This is one of the most common messages you can see when your workbook is corrupted.

But there is also a chance that it is just because of the version compatibility where you have a .xls file but you are using the latest version of Excel check out this detailed post by Priyanka

### 2\. We Found a Problem with some Content in this File…

There’s another error message which you can get while opening a file:

We Found a Problem with some content in Do you want us to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click yes.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/we-found-a-problem-with-some-content-in-this-file.jpg)

There are a lot of applications out there (I think almost every) which exports the data as a .xls format. Those files have a greater chance of having this kind of error.

### 3\. “Filename.xls” cannot be accessed

There can also be a situation where you get the error:

_“Filename.xls” cannot be accessed. The file may be corrupted, located on a server that is not responding._

Well, this message is a bit misleading.

You won't be able to decide that your file is actually corrupted or just not on the location.

## My Excel File Got Corrupted, now What Should I Do?

There are many ways to recover the data from the corrupt excel files. But before you start, it is always advised to create a copy of the corrupted file.

You can save a lot of time with [**Stellar Repair for Excel,**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which make data recovery just with few clicks.

But before you go for a data recovery software, let's try out some manual steps which can help.

When a workbook get corrupted the first thing comes to the mind is to recover data from it…

...and you what there’s a simple option there in the Excel which you can use to do this. Below are the steps you need to follow:

- First of all, open the Excel and click on the office icon.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/office-icon.jpg)

- After that, go to the “Open” and select the file which is corrupted.

- Now, click on the open drop-down and select “Open and Repair”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair.jpg)

- At this point, you have two options:

1. **Repair File**
2. **Extract Data**

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/extract-data.jpg)

Let’s get into both of these options one by one...

### 1\. Repair File

This option helps you to repair the file and the moment you click on it it takes a few seconds afterward and shows you the result with a message box and also provide you a log file.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/repair-file.jpg)

And once it is done with repairing, you'll get your file opened and you can save that file as a new copy.

Yes, that’s it.

### 2\. Extract Data

If somehow you aren’t able to get your file repaired, you can also extract data from that file using “Extract Data” option.

Even in this option, you can get data in two ways.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repair-options.png)

1. **As Values**
2. **With Formulas**

In the first option, Excel simply extracts data as value ignoring all the formulas driving those value (which is **the best way if you just need to have that data back** ).

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/open-repai-values.jpg)

But in the second option, Excel tries to recover the formulas as much as possible.

Check out this [**smart technique by Jyoti**](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) which you can use it you aren’t able to recover data from the file.

## Preventions to Not to have any Excel File Go Corrupt in Future

Future is fragile, what I’m trying to say is the more you work in Excel and process data there could be a chance that your workbook goes corrupt.

If there’s no security then what an EXCEL POWER user should do?

Well, there are few things which you can do or take care of while working with Excel so that you won’t have to worry about corruption of Excel workbooks.

Let’s see what you can do…

### 1\. Change Recalculation Option

Now here’s the thing when you work with a hell lot of data, there a common thing that you gotta using formulas. Right?

But, the thing these formulas are something which makes your Excel file slows down sometimes make them go corrupt.

There’s one small tweak you can do in your workbook is change the calculation method.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/change-recalculation-option.jpg)

Now with the manual calculation, you just need to whenever you open your file it won’t recalculate all the formulas.

And when you update your data you can simply click on the “Calculate Now” and it will calculate all the formulas again.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/calculate-now.jpg)

**Quick Tip:** Beware of Volatile Functions and use them with caution as recalculates them every time you change something in the worksheet.

### 2\. Use VBA Codes Instead of Formulas

Now, this is what I do when I need to use complex formulas in a workbook.

Here’s how you can do this: Let’s say you have a formula in the cell A1, like below, which calculates the age.

\="You age is "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"y") &" Year(s), "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"ym")& " Month(s) & "& DATEDIF(Date-of-Birth,TODAY(),"md")& " Day(s)."

Now, instead of simply entering it into the cell A1 which I would write a macro code which inserts this formula into the cell A1 and then convert it into the a value.

**Here’s the code:**

Sub CalculateAge()  
Range("B1").Value = \_  
"=""Your age is """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""y"")" & \_  
"&"" Year(s), """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""ym"")" & \_  
"&"" Month(s), and """ & \_  
"&DATEDIF(A1,TODAY(),""md"")" & \_  
"&"" Days(s)."""  
Range("B1") = Range("B1").Value  
End Sub

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/VBA-codes.jpg)

**Note:** To write these code you need to have basic understading of VBA (make sure [check out this guide](https://excelchamps.com/learn-vba/) for this).

### 3\. Use a File Recovery Application

Recently we asked a quick question to our readers on ExcelChamps that if they have ever faced a situation where they got a corruption message in Excel.

You’ll be astonied to hear that 50% percent of the people said “YES” they faced this thing in the past.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/Mac-Regional/yesr.jpg)

Now, this is alarming, if you are heading a team or you have a bunch of people in your company who use Excel…

…there’s a high probability that half of them gonna face this issue. So the best way to deal with this to have an App FIX your Excel file for you.

With **STELLAR REPAIR FOR EXCEL,** you just need a few clicks, yes that’s right. Let me show you with the below steps:

The freeze panes feature in Excel is used to freeze the row/column headings to keep them visible while scrolling the worksheet. It is a useful feature when you’re working on a large worksheet containing data that exceeds the rows and columns on the screen. Sometimes, you notice that the ‘Excel freeze panes feature is not working’. There could be numerous factors that can trigger this issue. Let’s know the reasons for the freeze pane not working issue in Excel and how to resolve this issue.

## Why can’t I freeze panes in excel?

- The Excel file is corrupted.
- The worksheet is protected.
- Advanced Options are disabled in Excel Settings.
- The Excel application is not up-to-date.
- You might be trying to lock rows in the middle of the worksheet.
- Your Excel workbook is not in normal file preview mode.
- Wrong/incorrect positioning of the frozen panes.

## How to fix ‘Freeze Panes not Working’ in Excel?

The freeze panes option is available in the View bar. Sometimes, you’re unable to see the View option. It usually occurs if you are using the Excel Started version. Check and try to open the file in the advanced Excel version, which supports all the features. If you are using the advanced Excel version, then try the below workarounds to fix the freeze panes not working issue in Excel.

### **Workaround 1: Exit the Cell Editing Mode**

If your Excel file is switched from normal file view mode to cell editing mode, you can encounter the freeze panes not working issue. In cell editing mode, certain features in Excel, such as the freeze panes, are temporarily disabled to prevent any conflicts. You can disable cell editing mode by pressing the ESC or Enter key. Now locate the View tab and check whether the freeze pane feature is working. If not, then try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2: Change the Page Layout View**

## How to Fix Excel Formulas Not Working Properly | Step-by-Step Guide

**Summary:** Excel formulas sometimes fail to function correctly and even return an error. This article explains what you might be doing wrong that prevents Excel formulas from working properly and solutions to resolve the issue. If your formulas have disappeared from the Excel spreadsheet and you are having trouble recovering them, you can use an Excel repair tool to recover the formulas.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

When working with Excel formulas, situations may arise when the formula doesn’t calculate or update automatically. Or, you may receive errors by clicking on a formula.

## Problems Causing the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue and Solutions

Let’s check out the possible reasons that cause Excel formulas to work properly and solutions to resolve the issue.

### Problem 1 – Switching Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode

Automatic and manual are the two modes of calculation in Microsoft Excel.

By default, Excel is set to automatic calculation mode. Everything is recalculated automatically when any changes are made in a worksheet in this mode. You may switch from automatic to manual mode to disable the recalculation of formulas, particularly when working with a large Excel file with too many formulas.

Excel will not calculate automatically when set to manual calculation mode. And this may make you think that the Excel formula is not working properly.

### Solution – Change Calculation Mode from Manual to Automatic

To do so, perform these steps:

- Click on the column with problematic formulas.
- Go to the **Formulas** tab, click the **Calculation Options** drop-down, and select **Automatic**.

![Automatic to Manual Calculation Mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/switch-manual-to-automatic-calculation-1.png)

### Problem 2 – Missing or Mismatched Parentheses

It’s easy to miss or incorrectly place parentheses or include extra parentheses in a complex formula. If a parenthesis is missing or mismatched and you click Enter after entering a formula, Excel displays a message window suggesting to fix the issue (refer to the screenshot below).

![Missing or Mismatched Parentheses](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/missing-or-mismatched-parantheses-2.png)

Clicking ‘Yes’ might help fix the issue. But Excel might not fix the parentheses properly, as it tends to add the missing parentheses at the end of a formula which won’t always be the case.

### Solution – Check for Visual Cues When Typing or Editing a Formula with Parentheses

When typing a formula or editing one, Excel provides visual cues to determine if there’s an issue with the parentheses inserted in a formula. Checking for these visual cues can help you fix missing/mismatched parentheses.

- Excel helps identify parenthesis pairs by highlighting them in different colors. For instance, the pair of parenthesis outside is black.
- Excel does not make the opening parentheses bold. So, if you’ve inserted the last closing parentheses in a formula, you can determine if your parentheses are mismatched.
- Excel helps identify parentheses pairs by highlighting and formatting them with the same color once you cross over them.

### Problem 3 – Formatting Cells in an Excel Formula

When adding a number in an Excel formula, don’t add any decimal separator or special characters like $ or €. You may use a comma to separate a function’s argument in an Excel formula or use a currency sign like $ or € as part of cell references. Formatting the numbers may prevent the formula from functioning correctly.

### Solution – Use Format Cells Option for Formatting

Use Format Cells instead of using a comma or currency signs for formatting a number in the formula. For instance, rather than entering a value of $10,000 in your formula, insert 10000, and click the ‘Ctrl+1’ keys together to open the Format Cells dialog box.

![Format Cells Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-3-1.png)

### Problem 4 – Formatting Numbers as Text

Numbers are displayed as left-aligned in a sheet in a worksheet, and text formatted numbers are right-aligned in cells. Excel considers numbers formatted as text to be text strings. Thus, it leaves those numbers out of calculations. As a result, a formula won’t work as intended. For example, in the following screenshot, you can see that the SUM formula works correctly for normal numbers. But, when the SUM formula is applied to numbers formatted as text, the formula doesn’t return the correct value.

![Cells Formatted as Text](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cells-formatted-as-text-4.png)

Sometimes, you may also see an apostrophe in the cells or green triangles in the top-left corner of all the cells when numbers in those cells are formatted as Text.

### Solution – Do Not Format Numbers as Text

To fix the issue, do the following:

- Select the cells with numbers stored as text, right-click on them, and click Format Cells.
- From the Format Cells window, click on Number and then press OK.

![Format Cells in Excel](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/format-cells-5.png)

### Problem 5 – Double Quotes to Enclose Numbers

Avoid enclosing numbers in a formula in double-quotes, as the numbers are interpreted as a string value.

Meaning if you enter a formula like =IF(A1>B1, “1”), Excel will consider the output one as a string and not a number. So, you won’t be able to use 1’s in calculations.

### Solution – Don’t Enclose Numbers in Double Quotes

Remove any double quotes around a number in your formula unless you want that number to be treated as text. For example, you can write the formula mentioned above as “1” =IF(A1>B1, 1).

### Problem 6 – Extra Space at Beginning of the Formula

When entering a formula, you may end up adding an extra space before the equal (=) sign. You may also add an apostrophe (‘) in the formula at times. As a result, the calculation won’t be performed and may return an error. This usually happens when you use a formula copied from the web.

### Solution – Remove Extra Space from the Formula

The fix to this issue is pretty simple. You need to look for extra space before the equal sign and remove it. Also, ensure there is an additional apostrophe added in the formula.

## Other Things to Consider to Fix the ‘Excel Formulas not Working Properly’ Issue

- If your Excel formula is not showing the result as intended, see this [blog](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
- When you refer to other worksheets with spaces or any non-alphabetical character in their names, enclose the names in ‘single quotation marks’. For example, an external 5reference to cell A2 in a sheet named Data enclose the name in single quotes: **‘Data’!A1**.
- You may see the formula instead of the result if you have accidentally clicked the ‘Show Formulas’ option. So, click on the problematic cell, click on the Formula tab, and then click Show Formulas.
- If you’re getting an error “Excel found a problem with one or more formula references in this worksheet”, find solutions to fix the error [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).
