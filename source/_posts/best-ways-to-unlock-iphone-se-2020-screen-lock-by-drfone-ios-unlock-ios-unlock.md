## Is It Possible to Unlock iPhone SE (2020) without a Passcode?

Unlocking an iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode is possible, but it's not as simple as entering a code. Besides, there are different methods that you can follow to unlock your iPhone SE (2020)

And we are going to teach all those methods with some simple steps. So, without any further ado, let's get started.

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the `Find My iPhone` function, then you can try it to unlock your iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![Use Find My iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.
- **Step 2**: Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.
- **Step 3**: Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.
- **Step 4**: Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your iPhone SE (2020) from the list of devices.
- **Step 5**: Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.
- **Step 6**: Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your iPhone SE (2020):

![Unlock it with iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/2.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone SE (2020) to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.
- **Step 2**: Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.
- **Step 3**: Once recognized, your iPhone SE (2020) will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.
- **Step 4**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.
- **Step 5**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your iPhone SE (2020):

![Use Recovery Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/3.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone SE (2020) to the computer and launch the iTunes application.
- **Step 2**: Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.
- **Step 3**: As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.
- **Step 4**: On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.
- **Step 5**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.
- **Step 6**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use a Third-Party Tool

If you are unable to unlock your iPhone SE (2020) using the above methods, you can use a third-party tool like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/). This tool is designed to help you unlock your iPhone SE (2020) without a passcode. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock to unlock your iPhone SE (2020):

- **Step 1**: Start Dr.Fone on your computer. Then, launch the program and select `Screen Unlock`.

![screen unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/4.avif)

- **Step 2**: Create the connection from your iPhone SE (2020) to the computer with a lightning cable.

![create connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/5.avif)

- **Step 3**: Follow the image on the screen to make your device enter in `DFU mode` or `Recovery mode`.

- **Step 4**: Once your device gets into DFU mode or Recovery mode, Dr.Fone will ask you to choose the right firmware for your iPhone SE (2020).

![choose firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/6.avif)

- **Step 5**: Upon selecting the right firmware, Dr.Fone will start downloading the firmware for your device. Once it's finished, click "Unlock Now" to remove the Passcode.

![unlock now](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/7.avif)

You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your iPhone SE (2020).

Once the process is completed, your iPhone SE (2020) will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your iPhone SE (2020) passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.




## Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your iPhone SE (2020) again.

- **Tip 1: About Passcodes**

1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

- **Tip 2: Use Face ID**

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your iPhone SE (2020), so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the iPhone disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

## How to Unlock Apple ID on iPhone SE (2020)

![How to Unlock Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/3.avif)

It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?

Here are the steps to unlock your Apple ID:

### Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication

Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts. If you have it enabled, you would be able to use two-factor authentication to unlock your Apple ID again.

- **Step 1**: Go to [https://iforgot.apple.com](https://secure.2checkout.com/order/cart.php?PRODS=4719741&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875).

- **Step 3**: Confirm your mobile number associated with the Apple ID.

![Confirm your mobile number](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/5.avif)

If you have another device associated with the Apple ID and it is a trusted device, you can now receive instructions to proceed with a two-factor code on that device.

![Two-factor code](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/6.avif)

## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone SE (2020) 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone SE (2020) Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled iPhone SE (2020). This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your iPhone.

- **Step 1**: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac.

![Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-a-disabled-iphone/6.avif)

- **Step 2**: Select your disabled iPhone SE (2020) from the devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled iPhone SE (2020) and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.


## Bypassing Activation Lock with a Professional Tool

For iPhone 5S to iPhone SE (2020) users who prefer an easier way to remove Activation Lock, `Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)` is a suitable option.

Dr.Fone is a set of modules that cater to a myriad of requirements that phone users can have from time to time, and one of them is the need to be able to disable the Activation Lock for Apple devices when the need arises. A need never arises in our wildest dreams, until it does, at the most inopportune time. It has, hasn't it?
