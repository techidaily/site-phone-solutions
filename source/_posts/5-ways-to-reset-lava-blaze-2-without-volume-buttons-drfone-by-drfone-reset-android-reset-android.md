**Step 5**: Dr. Fone only takes a few minutes to erase all data from your Android phone. Keep the phone connected, and don't open any phone management software.

**Step 6**: You will be asked to tap Factory Data Reset or Erase All Data after all app data, photos, and other private data have been completely erased. There will be a complete wipe of your phone.

### The Bottom Line

These are all methods for unlocking Lava Blaze 2 hard reset. It is possible to apply each technique if you have forgotten the password of your Lava Blaze 2 . You should use Dr.Fone - Phone Backup and Data Eraser to prevent data loss. It is possible, however, to try another method until you have unlocked your phone completely if one fails.
