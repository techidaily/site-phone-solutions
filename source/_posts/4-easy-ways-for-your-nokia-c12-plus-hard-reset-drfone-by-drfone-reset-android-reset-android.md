1. **How can I hard reset my Nokia C12 Plusphone without a PC?**

A hard reset basically wipes out everything from your device, including media files, contacts, and app data. As the above-mentioned methods indicate, you can easily perform a hard reset (aka factory reset) on your device without a PC.

2. **What is the difference between a hard reset and a soft reset?**

A soft reset means rebooting your device to fix minor issues. It is one of the easiest and quickest ways to refresh your device and improve performance speed. The process clears RAM data and can thus clear caches or other background processes interfering with your device's operations.

A hard reset is a process of restoring a device to its original factory conditions. Executing a hard reset means removing all data from your device, leaving you with a clean slate. A hard reset is useful for fixing serious issues on your device, such as virus attacks.

3. **How can I restore my Redmi in recovery mode?**

If your Redmi phone is stuck in recovery mode, you can try the following method to fix the issue:

Use the Volume Up and Down buttons to navigate your way through the recovery mode. Use the Power button to click on the "Reboot" option on the screen. This will make your device exit recovery mode and restart normally.

If this method does not work, you can wait for the battery to drain fully from your phone and reboot it normally.

### Conclusion

If you are also a Nokia C12 Plususer, you now know **how to factory reset your Nokia C12 Plusphone without a password** owing to the in-depth guide mentioned above. Using these easy methods, such as Dr.Fone for resetting your device, can help save you a great deal of trouble.
