## Part 3: FAQs

### **1\. Is it legal to use VPN to stream MLB TV?**

If you use a VPN to watch sports content, it is not an unlawful action, and you will not go to jail for this. However, you should consider avoiding doing this because it's against the MLB rules, and you will be disobeying them if you do this.

### **2\. Are there any alternatives to MLB TV?**

You can watch the baseball matches on different streaming websites, including Peacock, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, etc.

### **3\. Can MLB TV detect VPN?**

No, the MLB TV will not be able to detect the VPN because VPN masks your location and hides your real identity from everyone on the internet. The only condition is that the IP address provided by the VPN service should not be included in the MaxMind database.

### 4\. **Are regional blackouts grounded on billing address or the location?**

Regional blackouts are based on the physical location of the user. Therefore, if you want to see the teams that are subjected to the blackout at your location, you should enter the ZIP code of your area on MLB.com.
