<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question"><p>"Hi! My Oppo A18 phone captured a MP4 video clip but neither it nor other players can play it back correctly. The audio is ok but the video is in green and black and seems like five pictures tiled. How could I possibly repair the corrupted MP4 file? The video clip is very important and memorable for me. Thanks."</p></div><div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content"><p><strong>Know some of the instances that cause video corruption…</strong>  <li>Interruptions while transferring video files from one system to any device or vice versa</li>  <li>Using unreliable software for recovering the lost or deleted videos</li>  <li>Video file header corruption</li>  <li>Frequently converting your video file format</li>  <li>Trying to play video file on an unsupported media player</li></p>In all such instances your video files from Oppo A18 might get corrupt and become unplayable.
