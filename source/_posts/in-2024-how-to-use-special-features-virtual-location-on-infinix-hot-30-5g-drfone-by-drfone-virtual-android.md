### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

![apply fluctuation mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png)

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Step 2Import a GPX File

![wait for gpx file to load](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

Step 1Open Historical Records

Click the **Historical Records** button on the right pane to access the entire history involving the connected smartphone and the location spoofing platform.

## How to Share Location in Messenger On Infinix Hot 30 5G?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger. It basically works like other location-sharing features. However, Live Location provides more precise and thorough location information. It’s in map form, where you can view the exact location and track the movements of the sender. You’ll continue to see updates for as long as the sharing is not halted on the other end. To navigate it properly, try to read tutorials on how to share Live Location on Messenger.

![facebook messenger live location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-share-my-location-on-messenger-1.jpg)

The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.

Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm. Remember that safety remains a priority and comes above convenience.

## Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on Infinix Hot 30 5G and Browser

Have you ever wondered why you get the advertisements of the websites you visited a few minutes ago on your social media sites? Here comes to Cross-Site Tracking, also termed CST, and it is a process where third-party cookies and sites track your browser history.

![cross site tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/cross-site-tracking.jpg)

The CST process is like invading your privacy by collecting your browser history and personal information. So, to prevent these services, there are several ways by which you can cross-site tracking on your system as well as Infinix Hot 30 5G phone browsers. Keep reading to learn **how to stop cross-site tracking on both Infinix Hot 30 5G and browser.**

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Stop Cross-site Tracking?

Cross-site Tracking is all about collecting your browsing data and other information for advertising purposes. Though the process can prove convenient for many as it provides additional information about the products and services you have searched for and offers tailor-made content, it is intrusive and about breaching your privacy.

Cross-site tracking collects information about your browsing history. The third-party cookies also monitor the content type you have visited and your personal information, which is risky.

Besides invading privacy, the CST also poses several other issues. Based on your browsing history, additional content you have not asked for is loaded on your visited sites, slows down the page loading process, and puts an extra burden on your battery. Moreover, too much-unwanted content can interfere with the basic information you are looking for.

So, it is always better to prevent cross-site tracking for all the above and more reasons.
