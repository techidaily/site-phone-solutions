### The Difference Between These Two Methods

The conventional method of wiping your phone using the Android settings suffers a significant drawback. Due to the lack of data encryption by Android, data from almost 40% of formatted devices can be quickly recovered using data recovery tools. Even after a full factory reset, deleted files are retrievable to some extent.

The benefit of using Dr.Fone as your data eraser tool is that it can permanently erase everything on your phone. The program overwrites the phone memory with random data, hence securing your privacy. Data formatted via Dr.Fone cannot be recovered in any case, so you have nothing to worry about.

A hard reset basically wipes out everything from your device, including media files, contacts, and app data. As the above-mentioned methods indicate, you can easily perform a hard reset (aka factory reset) on your device without a PC.
