### Part 1: Circle Route (For Multi-Stop Route)

The circle route feature is under the multi-stop route mode. When your starting point is close to the ending point, a pop-up asks if you want to set up a circle route. Click **Yes** to create a circular path on the map.

![try setting a circle route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/circle-route.png)

### Part 2: Realistic Mode (For One-Stop Route and Multi-Stop Route)

This particular feature makes the simulation look realistic with the ability to fluctuate the speed of the simulation. If you wish to turn on realistic mode for the one-stop or multi-stop route, look for the respective checkmark option in the panel on the left.

![use realistic mode for accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/realistic-mode.png)

### Part 3: Fluctuation Mode (For Teleport Mode)

Whenever you are teleporting your smartphone device to another location, you can try using the fluctuation mode feature offered against it. As you activate **Teleport Mode** from the top-right section and search for a location, you will discover the **Fluctuation Mode** toggle in the confirmation tab. Turn on the toggle to slightly switch the location from the selected point to show realistic motion.

![apply fluctuation mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/fluctuation-mode.png)

### Part 4: Cooldown Timer (For Teleport Mode and Jump Teleport Mode)

While teleporting the location of your smartphone to different places for playing games like Pokemon Go, you are bound to activate a cooldown timer within your location-changing app to show realistic movement. By locating the **Cooldown Timer** on the right pane of icons, activate it, and this feature will automatically calculate the cooling time by measuring the distance between your destination and the starting point.

![try cooldown timer to avoid bans](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/cooldown-timer.png)

It is recommended not to start the movement until the cooldown time is completed to avoid unnecessary bans. Moreover, you can also activate the **Auto jump after cooldown** in the **Jump teleport mode** after turning on the Cooldown Timer.

This option will automatically jump you to the next destination once the timer ends. It is helpful for games like Pokemon Go, where the game servers can detect frequent jumps with no cooldown time.

### Part 5: Import/Export GPX File

You can also import and export specific navigated locations from Dr.Fone in the form of GPX files. While you can export GPX files for keeping a record of your location, you can also import such files for inserting specific locations to simulate or teleport to. Find out how you can import and export GPX files with this location-changing application:

Step 1Export the GPX File

If you have defined a proper location to simulate at a particular instant using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can have this location exported by clicking the **Export** icon on the top of the left panel. This will open a window where you can set the location for saving the GPX file.

![export location as a gpx file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/save-one-stop-route.png)

Step 2Import a GPX File

For importing a GPX file on the platform, click the **Import** button on the right pane. As this opens a window, select the GPX file you wish to import to the platform.

![import gpx file to the platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/import-gpx.png)

Step 3Wait for the File to be Read

Wait for a moment until Dr.Fone - Virtual Location recognizes the specific locations within the GPX file and displays them on the map.

![wait for gpx file to load](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/wait-import-gpx.png)

### Part 6: Historical Records

If you want to use a similar track record on your smartphone again, you can access the historical records saved on the platform for easy access.

Step 1Open Historical Records

Click the **Historical Records** button on the right pane to access the entire history involving the connected smartphone and the location spoofing platform.

![access historical records](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-1.png)

Step 2Access Any Location from the History

![move to any location from history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/history-records-2.png)

### Part 7: Favorite List

You can also set up favorite locations within the platform to define quick accessibility to your favorite locations. To do that, you have to follow the guidelines shown next:

Step 1Favorite Specific Locations

While setting up locations in Jump Teleport Mode, One-Stop Route, or Multi-Stop Route, you can tap on the **Favorite** icon adjacent to every marked location or favorite an entire route with the **Favorite** icon on the top of the left panel.

![save locations as favorite](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/find-favorites.png)

Step 2Access your Favorite Section

To look for your favorite locations, look for the **Favorite** icon on the right pane to open a list containing all locations you have marked. You can choose the **Move** option to automatically move into a particular location in no time.

**Step 4:** Click Get Started. NEW Feature: Xiaomi 14 users are now able to go wireless after setting this up the first time!

The screen shows your real location – as per the actual GPS coordinates of your device.

![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Xiaomi 14. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Xiaomi 14 app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

![drfone virtual location two point simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

**Step 3:** Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.

## Part 3: User Reviews for Fake GPS Location Pro

Are you still confused about the performance of this location spoofer app? We have provided some user reviews below to help you out:

| Reviewer | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Bobby Nichols | "I was using a different app for quite some time. However, if My Xiaomi 14 was inactive or not touched for more than 5 to 10 minutes. I would open it up to see that my real location had been found even though it said it was running and active. This app!!! I just tested it. Set it to a fake location and let My Xiaomi 14 sit untouched for an hour..... YEP! It was still working and displaying the false location I had set previously. Easy to use, great features. Highly recommended!" |
| Brian Thompson. | "Love it! It works perfectly. For those, however, who think this will let you trick web browsers with DRM content, or apps that aren't available in other locations, like Netflix, Hulu, MLB, etc., this will not help you. Those are determining your location by IP address and cell towers (if on cell data) not GPS! 5 start is you'd charge me a couple of bucks and let me get rid of the ads. Even something like $2 a year would generate more than the ads for the average user." |
| Gerald | "It just sends a picture of you want to share your location via text. If you send the link via Google maps the recipient has to press the play store link to see your location. What if they are not using an android phone? Also very sluggish." |
