Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Vivo Y78+. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Vivo Y78+ app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

## Part 1: What is Life360?

Life360 is one of the admired apps known for tracking location. The app can be used as a location-sharing platform as well as you can chat with your friends via the in-app chat feature. Here are the basics. All this app suggests is that a group of people whether an office projects group or simply a college team or maybe the family members, download and [install Life360 on their phones](https://www.virtuallocation.com/life360/). Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.

After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.

![life360 app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg)

Using this app then, you can simply see the location of the other members as well as get notifications named Place Alerts. These notifications will tell you whether a user has arrived or left the selected location. This can be helpful if you are a parent and want your children to reach safely at a desired place.

Moreover, with the help of Life360, a user can easily control the ‘Check-in’ according to which he or she sends the alert to the circle to know them the exact location. You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.

## Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?

Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.

For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.

For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.

## Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360

To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.

- This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.
- Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.
- Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.

## Part 6: How to Stop Life360 from Tracking you

### 6.1 Use a burner phone

If you completely want Life360 to stop you from tracking, the very first method, and indeed a useful one is using a burner phone. This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.

- Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone/Android.
- Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.
- There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.

**Note:** As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.

### 6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings

Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.

**Step 1:** At the lower right corner, hit on "Settings".

![settings of Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.

**Step 3:** Hit on "Location Sharing".

![go to Location Sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying "Location Sharing Paused" and you are done.

![pause location sharing for Life360](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg)

**Note:** When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.

## FAQs

1. **How do I delete my history on Life360?**

While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won't suffice.

2. **Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?**

Yes, it's possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Vivo Y78+ device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.

3. **How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.

4.  **If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?**

Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device's location services.

## Final Words

Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option.

However, there are situations when users feel uneasy about disclosing their whereabouts, and as a result, they might stop the feature from running.

Life360 hack - Here are some methods to stop sharing your location without them knowing.

### Method 1: Invest in a Burner Phone

Using an anonymous burner phone purchased with cash is a standard plot device in espionage movies and programs. There is a method that is the same as this for faking Life360.

**Step 1.** Your existing log-in information will work just as well when installing Life360 on your backup phone.

**Step 2.** When you arrive at your destination, connect your burner phone to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 3.** Don't use Life360 anymore on your phone.

![ invest in a burner phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Disable Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Access

Turning down the Vivo Y78+ device's potential to interact with Wi-Fi and cellular networks is another option for generating a false location.

**Step 1.** To prevent applications from renewing themselves in the background, you must use the option that saves battery life.

![ disable wi-fi and cellular data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-2.jpg)

**Step 2.** Disconnect from the internet through Wi-Fi and cellular data if you have them. For example, rather than disabling the whole Android system on an iPhone, you may simply disable the Life 360 app.

**Step 3.** Navigate to the settings menu, look for the Life360 option, and then off cellular data, background refresh, and the Motion & Fitness feature.

![ disable wi-fi and cellular data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-3.jpg)

Once these services are no longer active, your location data will no longer change.

### Method 3. Go For Dr.Fone

This is one of the best products to spoof or stop your location immediately. In addition, you can alter your GPS position whenever it is necessary with the help of [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS/Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/),.

Changing the Vivo Y78+ device's location info to improve it seems to be in another area or region is known as GPS spoofing. Using the program, you may enter and walk around any Phone location in virtual reality.

As a direct result of this, you will have access to all of the banned applications and will be able to have entertainment without having to move physically.

![start location faking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4.** Make sure you have a USB cable for your iPhone or iPad or Android that is compatible with your computer. Take a moment to unlock the Vivo Y78+ device, if necessary, and then press the Trust Device option.

![activate ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

**Step 5**. You may then identify your Phone.

**Step 6.** To teleport your Phone to a specific place, type its address into the address bar. Next, choose an area from the drop-down menu that appears.

![one stop teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

- **Step 7.** Make a selection and then touch "Move here."

- **Step 8**. Tap Still Move after you agree to the instructions.
