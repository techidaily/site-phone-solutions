Let us see how it works.

1. **Connect Your Android Phone**

Launch Dr.Fone on your computer. Select "Data Eraser" among all the tools to resolve the Nokia C32 hard reset.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Connect your Android phone to the computer using a USB cable. Make sure you have enabled USB debugging on your phone. If the Android os version is above 4.2.2, there will be a pop-up message on your phone asking you to allow USB debugging. Tap on "OK" to continue.

2. **Start Erasing Your Android Phone**

Then Dr.Fone will automatically recognize and connect your Android device. Click on the "Erase All Data" button to start erasing all your data.

![erase start](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-erase-02.png)

Since all the erased data are not recoverable, make sure you [have backed up all the needed data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) before you proceed. Then key in “000000” into the box to confirm your operation.

Type in "000000" to confirm and move on. Since you may lose your data in system repair and in case of a Nokia C32 hard reset, your phone's memory is wiped, it is always important to keep a backup of your phone data. More on this in the next section.

Then Dr.Fone will start erasing all data on your Android phone. The whole process takes only a few minutes. Please don't disconnect the phone or open any other phone management software on the computer.

3. **Perform Factory Data Reset on Your Phone**

After all app data, photos, and all other private data have been completely erased, Dr.Fone will ask you to tap on Factory Data Reset or Erase All Data on the phone. This will help you completely wipe all the settings on the phone.

**Now your Android phone has been completely wiped and it's like a brand new one.**

## Part 2: How to keep my data safe?

The best thing you can do to keep your data secure, even in case of unwanted crashes and accidents, is to periodically back up your phone and computer. So, you might ask what the best way to back up my phone is. We recommend [Dr.Fone - Phone Backup](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) because it is part of your phone's comprehensive suite of solutions and works efficiently without any technical input from you.

### The Bottom Line

In the current digital age, part of our life depends on our gadgets, so keeping them updated and tuned in is the best strategy to function without unwanted bumps. Obviously, it takes some pre-planning like periodic data backup, memory refresh, optimum charging, and so on. Dr.Fone is a comprehensive suite of applications that help you maintain your devices and fix them in case of an accident. This article discusses the Dr.Fone - Data Eraser for Nokia C32 hard reset.
