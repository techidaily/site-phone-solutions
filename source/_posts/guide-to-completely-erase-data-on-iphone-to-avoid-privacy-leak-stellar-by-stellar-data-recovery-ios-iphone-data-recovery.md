When you run out of solutions to troubleshoot your iPhone, Recovery Mode or DFU Mode comes as a rescue. Whether iPhone stops booting or fails to restore, you can use the functions in iPhone and fix the issue.

But the method to bring an iPhone in DFU or Recovery Mode varies in each iPhone model and iPad.

This post will guide you on how to enter and exit Recovery and DFU Modes in different iPhone and iPad variants. But first, understand what these iPhone functions are and their uses.

![How to Put iPhone or iPad on recovery mode](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Reamp_How-to-Enter-Recovery-or-DFU-Mode_edited-Clean.jpg)

## **What is Recovery Mode and its use?**

Recovery Mode uses iBoot to upgrade or restore your iPhone. iBoot is a bootloader program for iOS devices. Recovery Mode helps install the same or above iOS firmware version already on your iPhone. The iPhone screen in Recovery Mode prompts to connect iPhone to iTunes, showing a computer image.

Recovery Mode helps fix iPhone updates or restore issues, such as [iPhone stuck at the Apple logo](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-fix-an-iphone-stuck-on-the-apple-logo/), unable to open the locked iPhone or want to reset iPhone but [forgot iPhone passcode](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/forgot-iphone-password-best-solutions/).

## **What is DFU Mode and its use?**

Device Firmware Update or DFU mode lets your iPhone connect with iTunes on the computer without iBoot. As DFU mode doesn’t use iBoot, you can make changes in the operating system of the iOS device. An iPhone in DFU mode has a completely black screen.

Putting iPhone into DFU mode is the solution when Recovery Mode doesn’t resolve the problem. DFU mode can restore or upgrade iPhone. This mode is also commonly used to downgrade or [jailbreak iPhone](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/how-to-jailbreak-iphone-without-data-loss/)s.

### **Caution — you may lose all your iPhone data!**

If you are entering DFU mode, make sure to [back up your iPhone data](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/iphone/iph3ecf67d29/ios). DFU mode [permanently erases iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/erase-iphone-data.php). So always back up your videos, photos, messages, chats, Notes, etc., either to iCloud or iTunes.

However, if you have lost iPhone data and don’t have a backup, then immediately download iPhone data recovery software — [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/). The software helps to restore lost or deleted iPhone contacts, call logs, photos, videos, text, FaceTime, audio, chats, Calendar, Notes, Safari bookmarks, etc. It is quick to recover and extremely user-friendly.
