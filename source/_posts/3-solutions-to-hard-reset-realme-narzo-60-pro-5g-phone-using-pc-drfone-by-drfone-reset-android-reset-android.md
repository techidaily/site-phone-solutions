The easiest way to do an **Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G hard reset** is by using the factory reset option in the settings. This method will erase all data and settings, and you can easily do it in two easy steps. But it only works if you know the password of your phone. If you don't know the password and the phone is unlocked, it will still require a password for confirmation. Follow these steps for a hard reset from settings.

- Open settings and tap on the “system” option.
- Tap on the “Reset Options” in the system menu.
- Tap on Erase all data or factory reset.
- Enter the Password and tap reset for confirmation.
- The system will erase all data and reboot.

### 2: Restore with Recovery Mode

Suppose you want to hard reset your locked Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G phone, use the recovery mode. With recovery mode, you don't have to go to settings and erase data after providing the password. The only drawback of using recovery mode is that it is not best for beginners. Follow these steps for your **Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G hard reset** using recovery mode.

- Power off your mobile phone.
- Hold the volume up and power buttons.
- Enter the menu and navigate using the volume up and down buttons.
- Select Wipe data/factory reset using the power button.
