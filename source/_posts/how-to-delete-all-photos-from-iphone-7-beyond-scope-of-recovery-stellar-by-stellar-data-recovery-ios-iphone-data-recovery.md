To protect your privacy and prevent unauthorized access to your deleted iPhone photos, make sure your iPhone is wiped clean of all your previous photos before you sell, donate, or discard it.  

In this blog, we will talk about different ways to delete photos from iPhones beyond the scope of recovery.

## **How to Delete All Photos from iPhone?**

Before deleting all photos from the iPhone, it’s important to take a backup of all photos to avoid any accidental data loss situation. There are various ways to back up your iPhone photos:

### **1\. iCloud**

Use iCloud to back up all your photos automatically. To sync iCloud with Photos –

- Go to **Settings** > \[**your** **name**\] > **iCloud** > **Photos**, and turn on **iCloud** **Photos**.

![sync iCloud with Photos](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sync-icloud-with-photos.jpg)

Your photos will be backed up to iCloud automatically if your device has enough storage space and is connected to Wi-Fi.

### **2\. iTunes:**

You can even use iTunes to back up your iPhone photos. To do this,

- Connect your **iPhone** to your system.
- Launch **iTunes** and then select your **device**.
- Click **Summary** > “**Back Up Now**” to create a backup of all your data, including photos.

![sync Photos with iTunes](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sync-photos-with-iTunes.jpg)

Once you have backed up all your photos, proceed forward with deleting them from your iPhone.

## **Method 1: Delete Images From Photos and Recently Deleted Folder**

When you delete a photo from the iPhone, it’s not deleted permanently. Instead, it is moved to the **Recently Deleted** folder, where the deleted photos stay for 30 days before being permanently deleted.

**To permanently delete photos from the Recently Deleted folder, follow these steps:**

- Open the **Photos** app > **Albums**.
