They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor 100 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone's geographic location.

The best external device to change phone location Honor 100 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -

**Step 1**: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone's port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Honor 100 device to your iPhone.

![double location dongle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg)

Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location's official website.

![companion app double location map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg)

**Step 3**: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.

## Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 100 using XCode

You can change the geolocation Honor 100 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Honor 100 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Honor 100 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you've never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -

**Step 1**: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.

![download xcode app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg)

**Step 2**: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the 'Single View Application' to start a new Project and go on by clicking on 'Next'. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.

**Step 3**: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.

![identify yourself](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg)

**Step 4**: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config --global user.email "[<u>you@example.com</u>](mailto:you@example.com)" and git config --global user. name "your name".You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.

**Step 5**: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Honor 100 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.

![iphone connects to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg)

**Step 6**: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the 'Build Device' option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Honor 100 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.

![process-detection-on-iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg)

**Step 7**: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu > Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Honor 100 as well.

But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.

**Step 1**: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.

![cydia app download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg)

**Step 2**: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.

![enter new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg)

**Step 3**: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from 'OFF' to 'ON' at the bottom of the page.

![cydia toggle shift](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg)

**Step 4**: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an 'i' icon. Go click on it and choose the 'White List' option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone's location.

## Part 5: Change GPS Location on Honor 100 using Location Handle

Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -

**Step 1**: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store

![location handler cydia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg)

**Step 2**: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.

![teleport-coordination](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg)

**Step 3**: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.

![manual mode location handle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg)

**Step 4**: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.

![chowchilla location handler](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg)

**Step 5**: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.

## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Honor 100

PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN. It was developed by Microsoft and uses a GRE tunnel with a TCP control channel to bypass various geo-based restrictions. Since free PPTP VPN has been around for years now and is pretty easy to setup, it is quite popular as well. Read on and learn the basics of PPTP VPN free with a free PPTP VPN list as well.

## Part 1: What is PPTP VPN?

The free VPN PPTP was earlier introduced by Windows, but was later adopted by all the other platforms like Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, etc. Even though the layer of encryption in free PPTP VPN is not as secure as other protocols, it makes it pretty fast. Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
- The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.
