    Does Samsung Galaxy M14 5G have native support for MKV files? As a matter of fact, most Android devices need to install a third party media player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, Mobo Player, etc.) to watch MKV content. If for some reason this method doesn’t work for you, you need to convert MKV files to a format that is compatible with Samsung Galaxy M14 5G prior, such as H.264 MP4.
