## Life360: Learn How Everything Works On Samsung Galaxy S23+

Nothing is more important than your mobile device when it comes to your security, privacy, and family. Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.

Whether you're looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you've ever seen.

It's the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it's not the cheapest. So, let's know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.

## Part 1: What Is Life360?

A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one's safety and well-being.

When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members' arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.

Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.

Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.

Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.

Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.

In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user's location on the Life360 website.

## Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?

Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.

The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.

You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.

Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.

## Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?

Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.

According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.

If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app's location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.

You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.

There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.

Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.

Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.

## Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?

What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.

Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) which can help you change your location in real-time.

When Circle members are on the road, whether driving, using public transportation, or traveling with companions, keep an eye on their peak speed.

## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Samsung Galaxy S23+?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Samsung Galaxy S23+ devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your Samsung Galaxy S23+** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.
