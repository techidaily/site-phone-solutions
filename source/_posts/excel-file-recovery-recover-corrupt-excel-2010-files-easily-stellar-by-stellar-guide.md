![Excel-cannot-open-this-file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-cannot-open-this-file-img2.png)

## Why does Excel File turn Corrupt?

Following are some common reasons that can turn an Excel file corrupt:

- Large size of the Excel file
- The file is virus infected
- Hard drive on which Excel file is stored has developed bad sectors
- Abrupt system shutdown while working on a worksheet

## Workarounds to Recover Data from Corrupt Excel

The workarounds to recover corrupted Excel file 2016 data will vary depending on whether you can open the file or not.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Can Open the File?

If the corrupt Excel file is open, try any of the following workarounds to retrieve the data:

### **Workaround 1 – Use the Recover Unsaved Workbooks Option**

If your Excel file gets corrupt while you are working on it and you haven’t saved the changes, you can try retrieving the file’s data by following these steps:

- Open your Excel 2016 application and click on the **Open Other Workbooks** option.

![open-other-workbooks](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-other-workbooks-img3.png)

- Click the **Recover Unsaved Workbooks** button at the bottom of the ‘Recent Workbooks’ section.

![recover-unsaved-workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/recover-unsaved-workbook-img4.png)

- A window with list of unsaved Excel files will open. Click the corrupt file you want to open.

This will reopen your last saved version of the Excel workbook. If this method doesn’t work, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Revert to Last Saved Version of your Excel File**

If your Excel file gets corrupt in the middle of making any changes, you can recover the file’s data if the changes haven’t been saved. For this, you need to revert to the last saved version of your Excel file. Doing so will discard any changes that may have caused the file to turn corrupt. Here’s how to do it:

- In your Excel 2016 file, click **File** from the main menu.
- Click **Open**. From the list of workbooks under Recent workbooks, double-click the corrupt workbook that is already open in Excel.
- Click **Yes** when prompted to reopen the workbook.

Excel will revert the corrupt file to its last saved version. If it fails, skip to the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Save the Corrupted Excel File in Symbolic Link (SYLK) Format**

Saving an Excel file in SYLK format might help you filter out corrupted elements from the file. Here are the steps to do so:

- From your Excel **File** menu, choose **Save As**.
- In ‘Save As’ window that pops-up, from the **Save as type** dropdown list, choose the **SYLK (Symbolic Link)** option, and then click **Save**.

![symbolic link format](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/save-as-symbolic-link-format-img5.png)

**_Note:_** _Only the active sheet will be saved in workbook on choosing the SYLK format._

- Click **OK** when prompted that “The selected file type does not support workbooks that contain multiple sheets”. This will only save the active sheet.

![Workbooks contain multiple sheets warning msg](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Workbooks-contain-multiple-sheets-warning-msg-img6.png)

- Click **Yes** when the warning message appears - “Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as SYLK (Symbolic Link)”.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-message-img7.png)  

- Click **File** > **Open**.
- **Browse** the corrupt workbook saved with SYLK format (.slk) and open it.
- After opening the file, select **File** > **Save As**.
- In ‘Save as type’ dialog box, select Excel workbook.
- Rename the workbook and hit the **Save** button.

After performing these steps, a copy of your original workbook will be saved at the specified location.

How to Recover Corrupted Excel File 2016 Data When You Cannot Open the File?

If you can’t access the Excel file, apply one of these workarounds to salvage the file’s data.

### **Workaround 1 – Open and Repair the Excel File**

Excel automatically initiates ‘File Recovery’ mode on opening a corrupt file. After starting the auto-recovery mode, it attempts to reopen and repair the corrupt Excel file at the same time. If the auto-recovery mode does not start automatically, you can try to fix corrupted Excel file 2016 manually by using ‘Open and Repair’. Follow these steps:

- Open a blank file, click the **File** tab and select **Open**.
- **Browse** the location where the corrupt 2016 Excel file is stored.
- When an ‘Open’ dialog box appears, select the file you want to repair.
- Once the file is selected, click the arrow next to the **Open** button, and then click the **Open and Repair** button.
- Do any of these actions:
- Click **Repair** to fix corrupted file and recover data from it.
- Click **Extract Data** if you cannot repair the file or only need to extract values and formulas.

![repair excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/repair-excel-file-img8.jpg)

If performing these actions doesn’t help you retrieve the data, proceed with the next workaround.

### **Workaround 2 – Disable the Protected View Settings**

Follow these steps to disable the protected view settings in an Excel file:

- Open a blank 2016 workbook.

![blank excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/blank-excel-file-img9.png)

- Click the **File** tab and then select **Options**.

![Excel file options](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/Excel-file-options-img10.png)

- When an **Excel Options** window opens, click **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings.**

![open excel trust center settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/open-excel-trust-center-settings-img11.png)

- In the window that pops-up, choose **Protected View** from the left side navigation. Under ‘Protected View’, uncheck all the checkboxes, and then hit **OK**.

![disable-protected-view-settings](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/disable-protected-view-settings.png)

Now, try opening your corrupt Excel 2016 file. If it won’t open, try the next workaround.

### **Workaround 3 – Link to the Corrupt Excel File using External References**

If you only need to extract Excel file data without formulas or calculated values, use external references to link to your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Here’s how you can do it:

- From your Excel file, click **File** > **Open**.
- From the window that opens, click **Computer** and then click **Browse** and copy the name of your corrupt Excel 2016 file. Click the **Cancel** button.

![browse corrupted excel file](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/browse-corrupted-excel-file-img13.png)

- Go back to your Excel file, click **File** > **New** > **Blank workbook**.

![new excel workbook](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/recover-corrupted-excel-file/new-excel-workbook-img14.png)

- In the new Excel workbook, type “=CorruptExcelFile Name!A1” in cell A1 to reference cell A1 of the corrupted file. Replace the ‘CorruptExcelFile Name’ with the name of the corrupt file that you have copied above. Hit **ENTER**.
- If ‘Update Values’ dialog box appears, select the corrupt 2016 Excel file, and then click **OK**.
- If ‘Select Sheet’ dialog box pops-up, select a corrupt sheet, and press the **OK** button.
- Select and drag cell A1 till the columns required to store the data of your corrupted Excel file.
- Next, copy **row A** and drag it down to the rows needed to save the file’s data.
- Select and copy the file’s data.
- From the **Edit** menu, choose the **Paste Special** option and then select **Values**. Click **OK** to paste values and remove the reference links to the corrupt file.

Check the new Excel file for recoverable data. If this didn’t work, consider using an [Excel file repair tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/) to retrieve data.

## Data Disappears in Excel - How to get it back

**Summary:** You may face the issue of ‘Excel spreadsheet data disappeared’ after changing Excel file properties and formatting rows and columns. This blog discusses the possible reasons for data disappearance and the solutions to fix the issue. Also, it mentions an Excel file repair tool to retrieve the data from the file. Sometimes, while editing or formatting a cell in an Excel spreadsheet, the data may go missing or disappear. Let’s discuss in detail the reasons that may cause the ‘Excel data disappeared’ issue along with the solutions.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

## **Probable Reasons for Data Disappearing in MS Excel and Solutions Thereof**

### Reason 1 – Unsaved Data

While entering data in an Excel spreadsheet, it is important to save the data at frequent intervals. Doing so prevents any unsaved data from disappearing if you lose power or accidentally click ‘No’ when prompted to save the file. Unfortunately, such a situation is quite common as users often close the file without saving the recently made changes to a spreadsheet.

### Solution – Use the ‘AutoSave’ Feature

With the AutoSave feature enabled in Excel, data won’t be lost in the event of power failure or abruptly closing the Excel program. By default, Excel automatically saves the information in a spreadsheet after every 10 minutes. You can reduce the limit to a few seconds to reduce the chances of Excel file data lost after being saved.

![Change excel autosave internal](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/change-excel-autosave-interval-img-1-1.png)

### Reason 2 – Changing Excel Format

You can save an Excel file in various formats, like spreadsheet, text, webpage, and more. However, at times, saving the spreadsheet in a different format may lead to missing data. For example, when you save a workbook to a text file format, all formulas and calculations applied to the data will be lost.

### Solution – Adjust a Spreadsheet for the Changed Format 

If you’re changing the format of a spreadsheet, make space for the rows and columns. Also, remove all calculations before saving the file.

**Note:** If the sheet is shared on multiple computers, then save the file in compatibility mode.

### Reason 3 – Merging Cells

You can combine two or more cells data to make one large cell. This technique is primarily used to fit the text of a title in a sheet. If there is data in two or more cells, then only the data in the top-left cell is displayed and the data in all other cells is deleted. If the other merged cells have been populated with data after merging, the data is not featured and it does not appear even after remerging the cells.

### Solution – Merge Cells inside One Column

To merge cells without data loss, combine all the cells you want to merge within a column and do the following:

-   Select the cells to be combined.
-   Ensure that column width is wide enough to fit the contents of a cell.
-   In the spreadsheet, under the Editing group, click ‘Fill,’ and then click ‘Justify.’

![excel-fill-option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/excel-fill-option-img-2-1-1024x253.png)

-   Under Alignment, click on the ‘Merge & Center’ option to center align the text. Or, click on ‘Merge Cells’.

**Note:** This solution works for text only. You cannot use it to merge formulas or any numerical values. If you need to combine two or more cells with formula into a single cell, try using the [Excel CONCAT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/combine-text-from-two-or-more-cells-into-one-cell-81ba0946-ce78-42ed-b3c3-21340eb164a6).

### Reason 4 – Cell Formatting

Cells and text in the cells can be displayed in different colors to make the spreadsheet simple to create and infer. You may experience data loss when you try to modify the data or change the color or size of the data. Though the information may exist, the data may show an error due to the following reasons:  

-   White-colored text will not show in a white-colored cell
-   Large font-sized data may not appear in small-sized cell
-   Calculations may show (#VALUE) error after cell-formatting

### Solution – Check and Clear Formatting

Make sure to use dark-colored text on a white-colored cell. Also, resize the cell to fit the text size. Check if numbers in a cell are entered as text. If so, you need to apply a number format to the text-formatted numbers. Read more about it, from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/fix-text-formatted-numbers-by-applying-a-number-format-6599c03a-954d-4d83-b78a-23af2c8845d0).

## What Else You Can Do to Resolve the ‘Excel Data Disappeared’ Issue?

If you can’t recover the missing Excel file data, try to repair or extract the data from the file using the built-in **Excel repair tool**. Follow the below steps to use the tool:

-   Open MS Excel, click File > Open > Computer > Browse.
-   On the ‘Open’ window, select the file you want to repair and then click on the Open dropdown.
-   Select Open and Repair.

Use the ‘Repair’ option to repair the file and recover as much data as you can from the repaired file. If this doesn’t work, use the ‘Extract’ option to recover the data.

## Excel AutoRecover not working, what is next?

## Consider a Scenario

A professional with Windows 10 computer had MS Office 2016 installed on it. For an official purpose, he worked on an Excel workbook and saved it as an XLSX file. After working for hours on it, which was saved with a file name, a power outage occurred in his building for quite some time. After the power was back, he reopened Excel to find a list of recovered files in ‘Document Recovery’ section on the screen’s left side. However, the file that he had worked on recently was the ‘Original version,’ i.e. the last version saved by him and not the auto-saved Excel file. This meant the Excel document did not have any new data that was entered since the last time he saved it. Consequently, he lost hours of work. According to him, this happened despite the fact that the ‘AutoRecover’ feature was enabled. (Still, this needs to be checked and ensured.)

The 'AutoRecover' feature might not work in any of these cases:

- **AutoRecover Feature is disabled -** With this feature disabled, the Excel files are not auto-saved if the document is closed without saving, or the document closes unexpectedly due to an untoward incidence. To check, see if ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto-saved version if I close without saving’ checkboxes are checked or unchecked. If either one is unchecked or both are unchecked, it signifies that the AutoRecover feature is disabled. Else, the AutoRecover is enabled.
- **Corruption in the Excel XLSX file –** If ‘AutoRecover’ is enabled, most probably the cause is ‘damaged Excel XLSX file.’

Before discussing solutions to resolve the ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, let's have an overview of the 'AutoRecover' and 'AutoSave' features.

## A Brief Overview of Excel AutoRecover and AutoSave Feature

AutoRecover is an inbuilt feature in MS Excel 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, 2003, and 2007 that allows saving all of the ‘open Excel files’ at a fixed-interval in a user-specified location or AutoRecover file location. Besides, AutoSave is an add-in that exists in Excel 2002 and earlier versions to save all open Excel files in case of a crash, power outage, or accidental closure of Excel files without saving. Users can recover these files if Excel closes suddenly, for instance, at the time of power outage or failure. The auto-recovered Excel files are saved at a default location.

## Methods to Fix ‘Excel AutoRecover Not Working’ Issue

### Manual Methods

### Method 1 - Enable the 'AutoRecover' Feature if Disabled

Make sure that you have the ‘AutoRecover' feature enabled in your Excel application. If not, follow these steps to enable it:

- Open Excel with MS Excel 2016/2019
- Click on File and then on Options tab
- In ‘Excel Options’, click on Save tab
- Check ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’ and ‘Keep the last auto saved version if I close without saving’ box
- Set the time in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minutes’
- Click on the OK button

Note: With this method, it is not possible to recover data from the current Excel file. From next time onwards, the AutoRecover feature starts working following which Excel shall start auto-saving Excel files as per the time set in ‘Save AutoRecover information every \* minute’.

### Method 2 - Repair Corrupt Excel File

If corruption in Excel XLSX file has resulted in ‘Excel AutoRecover not working’ issue, you will need to [repair Excel file](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/).

- Go to location “C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles” to find Excel TMP files and save it as XLSX file

Note: In Windows 8, the location is the same as mentioned above that is for Windows 10. In Windows 7, the location is “C:\\Users\\name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\”

- Open a blank **Excel** sheet; click **File >> Open**
- Go to the location and folder containing the damaged Excel file
- In the **Open** dialog box, choose the damaged Excel file and click the arrow next to the Open button, and then click **Open and Repair**
- In the window that appears, click **Repair** to recover as much data as possible

## Repair Office 2016 Files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)on Windows

If you frequently work with Microsoft Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files, then issues like file inaccessibility or corruption won’t be new to you.

Let’s discuss some common scenarios which may lead to corrupt MS Office 2016 files:  

## Scenarios behind Microsoft Office Files Corruption

### Scenario 1 – Disruption during Data Migration

You decide to move Office files from your hard drive to other removable media. However, when you try to access the data within the files post-migration, you may find Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files showing gibberish characters. Due to a power surge, sudden system shutdown, and internal mechanical failure, the files may have turned corrupt.

![](https://www.stellarinfo.com/image/catalog/article/word/Word-displaying-gibberish-characters.png)

Figure 1- Microsoft Word file showing garbage characters

### Scenario 2 – Office Files and Registry Entries Become Infected

When you open or use the Microsoft Office application, it crashes as soon as it opens. You assume that an add-in was causing the problem and restart the Office application without add-ins loaded, but the application still crashes. This may happen because of a virus infecting the Office files and registry values, thus leading to corrupt or damaged Office files.

### **Scenario 3 – Inaccessible or Lost Data**

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

The error code 0x800A03EC in MS Excel can occur while exporting or importing Excel sheets to or from another application. It can occur when trying to execute a macro. It usually appears when the Excel application fails to read the queries in the VBA code, especially when using the PasteSpecial method (Range.PasteSpecial method) to paste cell data from the clipboard into an Excel sheet. It can occur if the cell data format is not compatible with the target data.

## **Causes of MS Excel Error Code 0x800A03EC**

The error code 0x800A03EC in Excel can occur in different scenarios. There could be several reasons associated with this error. Some of them are:

- Incompatible data formats.
- Trying to paste an extensive range of cells into a smaller range of cells.
- Add-ins are interrupting the code operation.
- Issue with the VBA code (incorrect or incomplete queries).
- Excel file is corrupted/damaged.
- Corrupted macros.
- Trying to export large-sized Excel file which is more than the Excel’s prescribed limit.
- Outdated Excel version.
- Incompatible cell formats on source and destination (when copying/pasting cell data).
- Missing cell range (forget to specify the range while using PasteSpecial method in the VBA code).
- Trying to save Excel file to incorrect directory.

## **Solutions to Fix MS Excel Error Code 0x800A03EC**

The error 0x800A03EC can appear if your Excel file is incompatible with your Excel application version. You can run the [compatibility checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-an-excel-workbook-for-compatibility-with-earlier-versions-of-excel-169a0336-965b-4430-8554-4e7b5db79947) to review the compatibility issues in your Excel file. If this is not the issue, then follow the below methods.

### Method 1: Review VBA Code

The exception from hresult 0x800a03ec excel can occur if you are trying to execute incorrect or incomplete queries in the Excel VBA code. It can also appear if the formulas do not contain the equal (=) symbol at the beginning. Verify the VBA code for any logical flaws, typo errors, syntax errors, or missing references.

### Method 2: Check the Field Size

Excel has certain [limits and specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). If the Excel file’s data exceeds these designated size limits, you can get the MS Excel error code 0x800A03EC error. For example, this error occurs if you try to export a file with more rows than the limit of 65536 and columns than the limit of 256. Check and optimize the file size by minimizing complex formulas and other objects.

### Method 3: Check Add-ins for Disabled Items

Sometimes, disabled items in Add-ins settings can prevent macros from functioning correctly. You can check and enable the disabled items in Add-ins using these steps:

- Navigate to **File > Options**.

![Go To Options Tab](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-options-tab.jpg)

- In **Excel Options**, click on the **Add-ins** option.
- Click the arrow corresponding to the **Manage** section.
- Select **Disabled Items** and click on the **Go** option.

![Go To Addins And Select Disabled Items](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-addins-and-select-disabled-items.jpg)

- You will see a list of disabled items.
- Click on the disabled items and then click **Enable**.
- Restart Excel for the applied changes to take effect.

### Method 4: Change Macro Settings

The error code 0x800A03EC can also occur if macros are disabled in the Macro Security settings. Follow these steps to change the macro settings in Excel:

- In MS Excel, go to **File > Options > Trust Center**.

![Click Trust Center Option](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-trust-center-option.jpg)

- Select **Enable all macros** and click **OK**.

### Method 5: Check the OLE Objects

The Microsoft Excel error code 0x800A03EC can also appear if there is a connection disruption in the VBA. Such an issue can occur if there is an issue with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) in an Excel workbook. The OLE objects are linked to external files. You can check and remove the unnecessary OLE objects from your Excel file to fix the issue.

### Method 6: Check Methods in VBA

Excel can throw the “Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC” error if you are trying to call an invalid method in a VBA code. Many users have reported this issue when trying to use ‘copy and paste’ feature using copy paste special [method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.pastespecial) (range.pastespecial) in Excel. Paste special is an advanced option in Excel to smooth the copy-and-paste task. While using this method, the exception can usually occur when Excel application detects an invalid or misaligned range or mismatch data type in the syntax. To fix this, check the syntax of the paste special method.

### Method 7: Repair your Excel File

Corruption in Excel file can create inconsistencies in the macro and lead to the “Exception from HRESULT 0x800a03ec Excel” error. In such a case, you can try repairing the Excel file using Microsoft’s inbuilt utility – Open and Repair. To use this utility, follow these steps:

- In the Excel application, go to the **File** tab and then click **Open**.

- Click on the **Repair** button to recover as much of the data as possible.
- After repair, a message is displayed. Click Close.
