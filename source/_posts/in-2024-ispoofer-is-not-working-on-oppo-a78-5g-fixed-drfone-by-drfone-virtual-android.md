## iSpoofer is not working On Oppo A78 5G? Fixed

Pokemon Go is one of the most appreciated games across the world. Yes, it has been banned in a few regions because of the controversial concept of the entire game but that’s one of the reasons why people turned to spoofer apps. While wanting to catch more Pokemon is the main reason for location spoofing, to evade the boundary barriers of the game is one more reason.

![Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Pokemon-Go-Location-Spoofing-pic-1.jpg)

However, if you have checked recently, iSpoofer has gone - MIA. You don’t find relevant sources to download the application and you don’t see your desperate attempts bringing any fruitful results. Does this mean that the good old days of iSpoofer’s popularity are over? Do we have to find an alternative or there are chances we might get the location changer back?

You will find the answers to all these questions in the clearly guided write-up below and yes, it i applicable for both Android and iOS users.

## **Part 1 - Does iSpoofer Still Work. Why?**

If you have encountered the iSpoofer not working problem, then you are among the several Pokemon Enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for an update. But the sad news is we never know if it will knock on our doors or not. The app still remains - non-functional. If you have the older version on your phone - uninstalled - and just lying there, you will notice that you will get a maintenance message saying that the app is under ‘maintanence’.

![pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-pic-2.jpg)

Your search through several blogs will tell that the app is going through some changes and might come back soon. But this may not be the case. Everything that goes around in the gaming world is to draw some recognition and revenue. iSpoofer has already gained its popularity among the gamers and revenue was coming in strongly - until the inevitable happened.

One of the main reasons for iSpoofer Pogo not working is its ban by the makers of Pokemon Go. Niantic is very particular about the rules that it had laid down for the players. One of them is a strict no to use any third-party apps while playing the game.

![iSpoofer -initial-error-message-official-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer%20-initial-error-message-official-pic-3.jpg)

iSpoofer not only changes the way you play the game but also defies the very concept of how the game should be perceived. You have to ‘Go’ out of the house. So, when Niantic banned the app, iSpoofer lost its very loyal customers. The main target audience were the players of Pokemon Go so you can expect how hard of an impact the loss must have brought to the revenue of iSpoofer.

So, the wise and safest option they had is to pull out and give it some time. It looks like Nianticis in no mood to give a nod to the Spoofing app (isn’t that obvious?) so iSpoofer Pokemon Go not working will remain to be a problem for a while.

![iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-previous-IV-pic-4.jpg)

There were high expectations that iSpoofer will revive back during 2020, owing to everyone staying home and being in desperate need of such spoofing apps but the audience only met with silence from their end. So, there are high chances that the very useful location spoofing app may not be around for a while at least.

## **Part 2 - How can I spoof on iOS safely?**

If there is someone who is very disappointed with iSpoofer going off of the chart, then it must be the iPhone users. iOS doesn’t provide diverse options to do something as ‘adventurous’ as changing the location on the Oppo A78 5G device. You have very little apps to choose from the play store.

If you are facing the iSpoofer iOS not working problem, then you can adopt one of the listed ways -

**VPNs** - This doesn’t imply that every VPN that is on the internet will help you spoof your location. There are certain blessed ones that come with an in-built location spoofing option that makes the job easier. If I have to name one - then you can use Surfshark. It can sustain you as long as you do not change your location too obnoxiously that the makers can detect the very quick change from point A to Point B that is humanly impossible. However, even if it is not as effective as iSpoofer, and definitely not an alternative, you at least get to enjoy temporary benefits.

![VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-surf-shark-option-pic-5.jpg)

**Apps on App Store** - This is one of the first things that anyone would do when they are in serious need of a location change. Go to the App Store and search for the ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’. However, you have to resort to the Trial and Error method here. Not all apps are going to work - some will be detected pretty quickly - while the others will simply take up space and nothing else. Until you settle on the suitable one, the search continues.

![App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/App-store-Location-Changers-pic-6.jpg)

## Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On Oppo A78 5G

Pokemon Go has graced one of the most popular mobile games right from the day it was launched. It requires players to move around one place to the other in reality to capture Pokémon. But if you don’t want to go out of his way and search for Pokémon then iPogo is a tool for you. It is a location spoofer that can change the location of your device. It allows you to move from one place to another with just one-tap. As it is a cheat tool, you might want to know can iPogo get you banned? There are chances of getting an iPogo ban, but they are relatively high depending on how you use the tool.

![ipogo ban intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-ban-intro.jpg)

## Part 1: How does the iPogo work for pokemon

iPogo comes with tons of add-on features that can be used to boost your Pokémon collection 10 folds. But it does that by breaking many rules and regulations created by Niantic. Here are some features of iPogo for Pokemon Go that are not by the books:

- **Play from anywhere, anytime:**

iPogo allows users to play Pokemon go anytime from anywhere in the world. All you will require is a decent internet connection, and you are good to go. And this is something that Niantic strongly opposes.

- **Spoofing:**

Niantic has arranged several ban waves once a week for players who were found cheating. The humorous thing to note here is that most of such players were caught spoofing. And this app lets you do exactly that. This also had a stimulating effect on the iPogo ban rates.

- **It works like a Go-Plus**

This app works like a virtual go-plus, enabling your device to change its location via switching servers. But that doesn’t assure any safety from the likes of Niantic.

- **Third-party software**

This app also works as a third-party software as it runs in the background while you are playing the game. Sometimes Niantic can detect that as well, and you might have to face an iPogo ban.

## Part 2: What’s the rate of iPogo ban

![ipogo ban intro 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-ban-intro-2.jpg)

Players mostly use iPogo for location spoofing, which is very common in Pokémon go. Niantic releases various patch notes to stop players from spoofing and catch those who are doing it. In Pokémon Go players, are banned on a 3-Strike basis.

If you are using iPogo as a location spoofer, kindly note that it is perilous to do that. If you receive the 1st strike as an iPogo ban, I strongly suggest you never use iPogo again because Niantic will keep a close watch on you. So if your question is, can iPogo get me banned? Then yes, it definitely can.

## Part 3: How to avoid getting banned by Pokemon Go while using a fake GPS tool?

Using a fake GPS tool in Pokemon Go is against the game's terms of service and can result in a ban. However, if you want to avoid getting banned, here are some tips to help you avoid getting banned while [faking Pokemon Go GPS](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-pokemon-go.html):

1. **Avoid suspicious behavior:** Niantic monitors player activities for any unusual or suspicious behavior. Avoid sudden changes in your location, and jumping between distant places within a short period, as these actions can raise red flags and increase the risk of a ban.

2. **Be aware of detection methods:** Niantic employs various detection methods to identify players who are using fake GPS tools or engaging in spoofing activities. These methods can include analyzing movement patterns, comparing location data with known landmarks, or detecting inconsistencies in player behavior. It's important to understand that detection methods can evolve, and it's difficult to completely avoid detection.

3. **Stay informed:** Keep yourself updated with Pokémon Go's terms of service and any changes or announcements made by Niantic. They may introduce new measures to combat cheating, and being aware of these updates can help you avoid unintentional violations.

4. **Use a trusted tool:** When using a fake GPS tool for Pokémon Go, it is crucial to choose a reliable and trusted app. Avoid using any random or unverified GPS spoofing apps. There is a reliable is recommended in the following part. Read on!
