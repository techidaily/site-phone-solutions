  “I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do with AVCHD .mts files on my Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition. They were taken with a Panasonic camera. I’d like to watch them on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition, but it refused to play them. So I'm stuck. Has anyone else figured out how to play the files in this .mts format on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition? Any suggestions?”

<p>
  The native video player on your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition will not support AVCHD files. However, you have two options to go through the issue. You can either install a third party video player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, MoboPlayer, etc.) or convert AVCHD .mts files to MP4 format via using a converter app. Check out a guide on how to re-encode AVCHD .mts files for playing on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition.
