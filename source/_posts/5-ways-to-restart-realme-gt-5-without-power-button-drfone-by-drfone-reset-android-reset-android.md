In some time your device will be reset into factory settings with all your data erased. The entire process will take a few minutes. Ensure that you have the phone at least 70% charged so that it does not run out of charge midway.

## Part 3: Does Wipe Data/ Factory Reset wipe all your data?

There are various instances where you would require performing a wipe/factory reset on your device. It might be because of some glitch that you would like to troubleshoot on your Android device. Wiping data from the phone is a universal solution in such cases. Even in cases where you want to sell your device, performing a factory reset seems the best option. What’s important is to make sure you don’t leave a trace of your personal information on the Realme GT 5 device. Therefore, wipe data/factory reset is never the ultimate solution to rely on. It is neither the best option anyway.

Contrary to conventional thought of relying on wipe data/factory reset Android believing it to be the best solution for wiping out complete data from the phone, all research outcomes have proved something different. It is easier to recover account tokens used to authenticate you when you enter a password for the first time, from service providers like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Google. Hence it is easier to restore the user’s credentials as well.

So, to protect your privacy and completely wipe data off the Realme GT 5 device, you can use Dr.Fone - Data Eraser. This is an amazing tool that erases everything on the Realme GT 5 device without leaving an ounce of data in it. Here’s how you can use [Dr.Fone - Data Eraser](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-data-eraser/) to completely wipe the data and protect privacy:
