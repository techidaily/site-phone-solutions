![drfone virtual location interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

That's it! You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here's how:

**Teleporting To Another Location**

**Step 1:** Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode

**Step 2:** Start typing your destination location and click Go

![drfone virtual location teleport](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3:** You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Poco X5. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.

**Simulating Movement Between Two Points**

Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here's how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Poco X5 app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:

**Step 1:** In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.

**Step 2:** Type your destination and click Go.

**Step 3:** A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).

**Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points**

Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can't deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.

**Step 1:** Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)

**Step 2:** Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.

## Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on Poco X5 and Browser

Have you ever wondered why you get the advertisements of the websites you visited a few minutes ago on your social media sites? Here comes to Cross-Site Tracking, also termed CST, and it is a process where third-party cookies and sites track your browser history.

![cross site tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/cross-site-tracking.jpg)

Cross-site Tracking is all about collecting your browsing data and other information for advertising purposes. Though the process can prove convenient for many as it provides additional information about the products and services you have searched for and offers tailor-made content, it is intrusive and about breaching your privacy.

Moreover, too much-unwanted content can interfere with the basic information you are looking for.

So, it is always better to prevent cross-site tracking for all the above and more reasons.
