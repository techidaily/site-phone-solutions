This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your OnePlus 12 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change OnePlus 12 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus 12 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus 12 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus 12 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus 12 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus 12 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus 12 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus 12 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus 12 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus 12 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-12-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-12-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus 12 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus 12 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/joystick-mode-pic24.jpg"                      alt="joystick-mode"                ></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We hope you are no longer wondering How to change Location services on OnePlus 12.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your OnePlus 12 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page.

Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-can-i-play-mov-files-on-motorola-moto-g73-5g-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mov-on-android/"><u>How can I play .mov files on Motorola Moto G73 5G ?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/fix-file-not-loaded-completely-error-in-excel-2021-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Fix File Not Loaded Completely Error in Excel 2021</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-video-files-on-vivo-t2-pro-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>Complete guide for recovering video files on Vivo T2 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-pictures-from-nubia-red-magic-8s-proplus-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted pictures from Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-call-history-from-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted call history from Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/fixed-excel-2010-found-a-problem-with-one-or-more-formula-stellar-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Fixed Excel 2010 Found a Problem with One or more Formula | Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/failed-to-play-mp4-movies-with-xiaomi-redmi-k70-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mp4-on-android/"><u>Failed to play MP4 movies with Xiaomi Redmi K70</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-on-a60s-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>How To Bypass Google FRP on A60s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-on-honor-90-gt-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>How To Bypass Google FRP on Honor 90 GT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-irresistible-thumbnails-a-step-by-step-youtube-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated Crafting Irresistible Thumbnails A Step-by-Step YouTube Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-honor-play-40c-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Honor Play 40C to Samsung Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-steps-in-using-streamlabs-obs-successfully/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Essential Steps in Using Streamlabs OBS Successfully</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-swift-skills-sharpen-your-windows-images/"><u>[New] Swift Skills  Sharpen Your Windows Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/the-art-of-crafting-captivating-facebook-stories-for-2024/"><u>The Art of Crafting Captivating Facebook Stories for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-your-ae-leading-text-plugins-reviewed/"><u>2024 Approved  Maximizing Your AE  Leading Text Plugins Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/ways-to-stop-parent-tracking-your-vivo-y27s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ways to stop parent tracking your Vivo Y27s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-change-video-speed-in-quicktime-player-on-your-computer/"><u>New In 2024, How to Change Video Speed in QuickTime Player on Your Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/identify-malfunctioning-hardware-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-on-windows-11-and-10-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Identify malfunctioning hardware drivers with Windows Device Manager on Windows 11 & 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-distribute-your-youtube-collection/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Guide  Distribute Your YouTube Collection</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You don’t have to buy any new equipment and you will be operating using your computer.</p><p>You can get this done within minutes if you have the right program with you. One of the best options in the market is Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. This is how you use Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer for GPS Spoofing iPhone.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change OnePlus Ace 2 Pro Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Ace 2 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus Ace 2 Pro by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Ace 2 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services. In case you’ve already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you’ve been facing. Just open Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg"                      alt="enable location services"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-Date-and-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Adjust-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-Date-and-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  Date and Time"></a>Tip 3: Adjust OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  Date and Time</h3><p>As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to “Set Automatically” in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg"                      alt="adjust date and time"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Check-the-Internet"><a href="#Tip-4-Check-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Check the Internet"></a>Tip 4: Check the Internet</h3><p>Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  because your device doesn’t have internet access. Try opening Settings &gt; Mobile Data&#x2F;Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg"                      alt="check internet connection"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location"><a href="#Tip-5-Enable-Share-My-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Enable Share My Location"></a>Tip 5: Enable Share My Location</h3><p>Another tip to try out when your friend’s location is not available is to make certain that you’ve enabled <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-share-location-on-messenger.html" >Share My Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  users: get to the “Settings” app and go to “Privacy &amp; Security”. You will find the “Location Services” feature, click on it, and see the “Share My Location” feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-share-my-location.jpg"                      alt="enable share my location"                ></p><p>Toggle on the option to enable it. Once the feature is enabled, your friends will see your location, and you can see theirs.</p><p>For Android users, go to “Settings” &gt; “Additional settings” &gt; “Privacy” &gt; “Location”, and choose the location mode to enable it.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-or-Android-Phones"><a href="#Tip-6-Restart-the-OnePlus-Ace-2-Pro-or-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  or Android Phones"></a>Tip 6: Restart the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  or Android Phones</h3><p>The next tip to use when Find My Friends says location not available is restarting your phone. For most devices, the method is common. But for OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  X and 11, the steps are slightly different. For other OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  models, press the Power button and wait until the slider appears. For OnePlus Ace 2 Pro  X and 11&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;14, you’ll have to hold the Volume button and the Power button together to make the slider appear on the screen.</p><p>![restart OnePlus Ace 2 Pro](<a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus" >https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/restart-OnePlus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Ace 2 Pro .jpg)</p><p>Drag the Power slider to the right side and wait for the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device to shut down.

Make sure that you also clear the cache memory before opening the app again. It might fix the problem entirely.</p><h2 id="Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others"><a href="#Extension-Can-I-send-the-fake-location-by-Find-Friends-to-others" class="headerlink" title="Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?"></a>Extension: Can I send the fake location by Find Friends to others?</h2><p>With Dr. Fone - Virtual Location software, you will be able to share <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends.html" >a fake or any location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you want with your friends and family.

The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo Find X7 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo Find X7 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Find X7 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo Find X7 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo Find X7 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo Find X7 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo Find X7 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo Find X7 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo Find X7 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Find X7 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Find X7 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Can It Be Detected?</h2><p>One of the most frequent and completely understandable concern and question on people’s minds when they talk about location spoofing is whether is it safe to mock location whether it can be detected and what the consequences are.</p><p>Answer: Location spoofing is safe and will go undetected as long as it is done sensibly and with the right mock location app on your iPhone and Android. You have nothing to worry about as long as you do not be particularly obvious about location mocking. This means that you should take care not to be hopping like a bunny from here and there in minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Top-Mock-Location-Apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-III-Top-Mock-Location-Apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone"></a>Part III: Top Mock Location Apps for iPhone</h2><p>There are fewer mock location apps on the Apple Store due to Apple’s strict policies on user privacy and security.

How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.</p><p>- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.</p><h2 id="Closing-Words"><a href="#Closing-Words" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Using a mock location app can be fun.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Oppo Find X7 Ultra device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Oppo Find X7 Ultra Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 Ultra using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 Ultra using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo Find X7 Ultra location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo Find X7 Ultra is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X7-Ultra-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 Ultra using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X7 Ultra using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo Find X7 Ultra by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo Find X7 Ultra by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo Find X7 Ultra stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo Find X7 Ultra device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo Find X7 Ultra unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part.

You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?"></a>Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?</h2><p>Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.</p><p>For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.</p><p>For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360"><a href="#Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360"></a>Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360</h2><p>To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.</p><ul><li>This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.</li><li>Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.</li><li>Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Fake your Life360 location to any other address you require with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

Well! You can go for a spoofing app for this too. There are lots of them available at the Google Play Store. For more clarity, we will help you know how you can use a spoofer app for Life360 fake location. Make sure to go along with the steps carefully.</p><p>Before you get the app worked, here is a requirement you need to follow. The requirement simply says you to enable the developer options in your Oppo Find X7 Ultra. If you know how to do it, it’s good. But if you don’t here are the steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open “Settings” in the first place and tap on “System”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-1.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, you need to go to the “About Phone” option. Followed by this, head to “Software info”.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will find the build number of your device here. You have to tap on it nearly 7 times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-2.jpg"                      alt="build number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, enter the lock code when asked and the developer options will be enabled.</p><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer"></a>Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Now that you have turned on the developer options, you can visit the Play Store and look for Fake GPS Location app. Install it on your phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, again go to “Settings” &gt; “System” &gt; “Developer Options”.

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> At the lower right corner, hit on “Settings”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg"                      alt="settings of Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hit on “Location Sharing”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg"                      alt="go to Location Sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying “Location Sharing Paused” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing for Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><ol><li><strong>How do I delete my history on Life360?</strong></li></ol><p>While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won’t suffice.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, it’s possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Oppo Find X7 Ultra device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?</strong></li></ol><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.</p><ol start="4"><li> <strong>If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?</strong></li></ol><p>Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device’s location services.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option. We discussed some helpful ways <strong>how to fake your location on Life360</strong> in this article, including <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which allows you to manipulate your GPS location, simulate routes, and set up geofences, making it a versatile solution for your location spoofing needs.

It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your OnePlus Open device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Open location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Open is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Open device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Open-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Open-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Open using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Open using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus Open by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Open by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Open stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Open device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Open unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus Open as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Open-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Open-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Open using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Open using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Open-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Open-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Open using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Open using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location.

It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Reno-11-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo A18 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo A18 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo A18 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo A18 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo A18 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo A18 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo A18 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo A18 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-A18-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-A18-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo A18 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo A18 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

There are only two ways to remove your Life360 history, though – deleting the Life360 account itself or removing a device from the Life360 Circle.

In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.</p><p>Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.</p><p>Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.</p><p>Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device.

For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user’s location on the Life360 website.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-Life360-Always-Accurate"><a href="#Part-3-Is-Life360-Always-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?"></a>Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?</h2><p>Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.</p><p>The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.</p><p>You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.</p><p>Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Is-Life360-Safe-for-Your-Privacy"><a href="#Part-4-Is-Life360-Safe-for-Your-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?"></a>Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?</h2><p>Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately.

The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.</p><p>If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app’s location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.</p><p>You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Oppo A1x 5G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Oppo A1x 5G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A1x-5G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A1x-5G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo A1x 5G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo A1x 5G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo A1x 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo A1x 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo A1x 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A1x-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A1x-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo A1x 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo A1x 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo A1x 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo A1x 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo A1x 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo A1x 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo A1x 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo A1x 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-A1x-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-A1x-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo A1x 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo A1x 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website.

As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="verify the netwrok connection"                ></p><h3 id="6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded"><a href="#6-Checking-that-all-dependent-components-have-been-downloaded" class="headerlink" title="6.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo Find X6 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo Find X6 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Find X6 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo Find X6 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo Find X6 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo Find X6 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo Find X6 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo Find X6 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Find-X6-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Find-X6-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Find X6 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Find X6 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X6-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Find-X6-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X6 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Oppo Find X6 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in.

Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use.

People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries.

If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location.

Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account.

You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Oppo-Find-X6"><a href="#Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Oppo-Find-X6" class="headerlink" title="Will iSpoofer update On Oppo Find X6"></a>Will iSpoofer update On Oppo Find X6</h2><p>iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Oppo Find X6 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-t-open-mov-files-on-redmi-a2-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mov-on-android/"><u>Can't open MOV files on Redmi A2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/honor-messages-recovery-recover-deleted-messages-from-honor-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Honor Messages Recovery - Recover Deleted Messages from Honor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-data-from-c110-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted data from C110</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/4-easy-ways-for-your-honor-magic-v2-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>4 Easy Ways for Your Honor Magic V2 Hard Reset | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-restart-realme-12-pro-5g-without-power-button-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>5 Ways to Restart Realme 12 Pro 5G Without Power Button | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-music-from-meizu-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Undelete Lost Music from Meizu</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-oppo-a79-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Oppo A79 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-motorola-moto-g14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Motorola Moto G14? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-journey-into-soundscapes-apples-ipodcast-playback-on-iphone/"><u>In 2024, Journey Into Soundscapes  Apple's iPodcast Playback on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-review-unveiling-the-potential-of-vidma-capture-tech/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Review  Unveiling the Potential of Vidma Capture Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Apple iPhone 13 mini? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-on-using-gaming-youtube-banner-templates/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Step-By-Step Guide on Using Gaming YouTube Banner Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-non-twitter-social-sites-of-the-year-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Non-Twitter Social Sites of the Year for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/long-term-snappiness-keeping-streaks-uninterrupted/"><u>Long-Term Snappiness  Keeping Streaks Uninterrupted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/best-mac-gif-capture-top-10-edition-for-2024/"><u>Best Mac GIF Capture  Top 10 Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhancing-presentations-with-sound-in-depth-techniques-for-recording-audio-in-powerpoint-on-pcmac-platforms/"><u>In 2024, Enhancing Presentations with Sound In-Depth Techniques for Recording Audio in PowerPoint on PC/Mac Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/digital-beat-downloads-accessing-dj-anthems-for-2024/"><u>Digital Beat Downloads Accessing DJ Anthems for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Nord N30 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Nord N30 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Nord N30 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Nord N30 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity.

You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Nord N30 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Nord N30 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part.

Navigate to the map screen and select the “Teleport Mode” icon, which is situated as the first option in the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now, start the process by tapping the search bar at the top left corner, inputting your desired location, and hitting “Enter.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select the desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Move to the Targeted Location and Verify It</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the initial setup, proceed to teleport to the targeted location by clicking “Move Here” on the map screen. This action prompts the cursor to relocate to the specified location on the map. It also simultaneously adjusts the location of your Android or iOS device. To validate the successful location change, access your smartphone and open a map application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="click the move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem"><a href="#Part-3-Why-is-GPS-Spoofing-a-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?"></a>Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?</h2><p>Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.</p><p>However, if you’re on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it’s too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you’re receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.</p><p>Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.</p><p><strong>Food Delivery</strong></p><p>Couriers who use GPS spoofing can trick food delivery apps into allowing them to accept orders they otherwise would not have access to. They may also gain an unfair advantage to gain priority in order queues and report longer rides to earn more from the platform. In addition, a more egregious issue is couriers charging for deliveries that weren’t made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-03.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing on food delivery driver apps"                ></p><p><strong>Gaming</strong></p><p>Using GPS spoofing in MMORPGs enables gamers to take advantage of faking their position without moving into the comforts of their own home. This can lead to more in-game rewards that are otherwise difficult to achieve without GPS spoofing.</p><p>Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.</p><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong></p><p>Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.</p><p>There are various ways to protect yourself from being on the other end of a fake GPS location. You can easily use specialized apps, including <a class="link"   href="https://apkpure.com/mock-location-root-detector/com.check.mock" >mock location detection APKs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you’re on Android. These anti-spoofing GPS apps help detect if someone is providing fake GPS locations. However, if this is not available to you, there are several ways you can mitigate malicious actors by applying some safeguards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/detect-fake-gps-location-04.jpg"                      alt="mock location detection apks"                ></p><p>Here are some of the methods you can take advantage of.</p><ul><li>Cross-reference location data from multiple sources to detect fake GPS locations. You can cross reference from GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell tower triangulation to analyze accurate GPS.</li><li>Analyze abnormal patterns in location data presented to you from sudden jumps in location or having unrealistic speeds during movement.</li><li>Verify the accuracy of GPS by comparing location data to known landmarks, including buildings, bridges, or roads.</li><li>Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.</li><li>Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user’s smartphone.</li></ul><p>While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it’s important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods. You can easily detect mock locations on Android, but the methods available if you’re on a different device will vary depending on the resources at your disposal.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Faking your GPS is easy nowadays.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-8S-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Oppo A38 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Oppo A38 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A38-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A38-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo A38 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo A38 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo A38 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo A38 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo A38 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A38-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A38-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo A38 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo A38 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo A38 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo A38 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo A38 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo A38 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts.

While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="activate one stop route mode"                ></p><p>Step 2Define Simulation Parameters</p><p>Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a <strong>Round trip</strong> or a <strong>Loop trip</strong>. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click <strong>Move Here</strong> on the bottom to start the movement simulation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="set parameters to simulate"                ></p><p>Step 3Start Simulation Movement</p><p>The respective simulation starts, and you can see your position is moving on the map with the speed you set. If you wish to hold the simulation, click <strong>Pause</strong> or tap <strong>Clear</strong> to revert to your original state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="start one stop simulation"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Simulate-Movement-Along-a-Route-Multi-Stop-Route"><a href="#Part-2-Simulate-Movement-Along-a-Route-Multi-Stop-Route" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)"></a>Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)</h3><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android&#x2F;**iOS:</p><p>Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters</p><p>Activate the <strong>Multi-Stop Route</strong> mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click <strong>Start Moving</strong> to initiate the process.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="activate multi stop simulation"                ></p><p>Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement</p><p>As the simulation starts, click <strong>Pause</strong> at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also <strong>Clear</strong> all settings if required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="execute multi stop route simulation"                ></p><h3 id="Part-3-Use-Joystick-for-More-Flexible-GPS-Control-Joystick-Movement"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Joystick-for-More-Flexible-GPS-Control-Joystick-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)"></a>Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)</h3><p>Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="try joystick movement for simulation"                ></p><p>The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what’s better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.</p><ul><li><strong>Automatic GPS movement:</strong> Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.</li><li><strong>Manual GPS movement:</strong> Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.</li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-convert-avchd-mts-files-for-sony-xperia-10-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mts-on-android/"><u>How to convert AVCHD .mts files for Sony Xperia 10 V?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-motorola-razr-40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Motorola Razr 40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ispoofer-is-not-working-on-tecno-phantom-v-flip-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iSpoofer is not working On Tecno Phantom V Flip?

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo A78 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo A78 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo A78 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A78-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A78-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo A78 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo A78 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo A78 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo A78 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo A78 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Oppo A78 5G device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location.

To start with, launch Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center.</p><p>2. From here, you need to select the “Set up a new connection or network” option to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-2.png"                      alt="free pptp vpn connection"                ></p><p>3.

On the next window, you would be given an option to either dial directly or use a VPN. Click on the “Use my Internet Connection (VPN)” option to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-4.png"                      alt="Use my Internet Connection"                ></p><p>5.

Go to the Security tab and make sure the type of VPN is listed as PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol). Also, the data encryption option should be “Optional Encryption (Connect even if no encryption)” and the option for “Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)” should be selected for “Allow these protocols”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-6.jpg"                      alt="pptp vpn properties"                ></p><p>10.

One of the best options in the market is Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. This is how you use Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer for GPS Spoofing iPhone.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your OnePlus 12R device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change OnePlus 12R Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12R-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12R-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12R using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12R using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus 12R location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus 12R is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus 12R device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12R-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-12R-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12R using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus 12R using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus 12R by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus 12R by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus 12R stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus 12R device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus 12R unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus 12R as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-12R-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-12R-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus 12R using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus 12R using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Of course, you can also run the software in the background, which may be accomplished in a variety of straightforward but distinct ways based on the OnePlus 12R device’s model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location_2.jpg"                      alt="double-check your current location"                ></p><p>You may access the Background App Refresh function by going to the settings menu on your iOS device and selecting “Settings,” followed by “General,” and then selecting “Background App Refresh.” Next, launch the location services function by navigating to “Settings”&gt; “Privacy”&gt; “location services” and selecting “Location Services” from the drop-down menu.</p><p>After that, touch on the symbol that represents Life360, as shown below; this will take you to a screen where you may change “Allow Location Access” to “Always” and “Enable Precise Location.”</p><h3 id="Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time"><a href="#Method-3-Connecting-One-Device-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time"></a>Method 3: Connecting One Device at a Time</h3><p>Only one device may be used to sign in to the Life 360 app at a time. To prevent the life360 false location problem, log out of all other devices and use just one. When many devices are logged into Life 360 simultaneously, the user’s location might be incorrectly determined.</p><p>If you want reliable results, you must be logged in from the same device. If you use numerous devices simultaneously to log in to Life360, it will report incorrect location errors for each one. Therefore, it is possible to get inaccurate data.

This will switch off the cellular data for the Life360 app. Turn off Life360 by swiping the switch to the off position mentioned above.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo F23 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo F23 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo F23 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box.

Thus, your location settings show modified coordinates whenever you browse the internet with a VPN enabled. That also works with streaming Netflix shows that are currently restricted in your region. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide on how to change your location on Netflix using Virtual Private Networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First and foremost, check the current standing of your Netflix account and make sure it is active.

It reroutes your internet traffic to a particular server from a different location. Through this tactic, Netflix fails to detect that you’re using its service from a restricted region. A web proxy server is often free of charge. Thus, it’s a great alternative to VPNs if you don’t want to spend money just to access unavailable content on your device. Do you want to try it now?

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your OnePlus Ace 3 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change OnePlus Ace 3 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-3-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-3-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 3 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 3 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Ace 3 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Ace 3 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Ace 3 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-3-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-3-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 3 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 3 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus Ace 3 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Ace 3 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Ace 3 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Ace 3 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Ace 3 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus Ace 3 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Ace-3-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Ace-3-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Ace 3 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Ace 3 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Nubia-Red-Magic-9-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo A2 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo A2 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo A2 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo A2 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo A2 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo A2 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo A2 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo A2 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-A2-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-A2-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo A2 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo A2 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A2-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-A2-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Oppo A2 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Oppo A2 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Nord-CE-3-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website.

They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the OnePlus Ace 2 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location OnePlus Ace 2 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the OnePlus Ace 2 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation OnePlus Ace 2 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in OnePlus Ace 2 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your OnePlus Ace 2 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your OnePlus Ace 2 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your OnePlus Ace 2 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your OnePlus Ace 2 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Ace 2 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on OnePlus Ace 2 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-OnePlus-Ace-2-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on OnePlus Ace 2 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location.
