This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Apple iPhone 7 Plus device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Apple iPhone 7 Plus Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 7 Plus location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 7 Plus’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 7 Plus is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 7 Plus’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to your Apple iPhone 7 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 7 Plus by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 7 Plus by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 7 Plus stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 7 Plus unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 7 Plus using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/joystick-mode-pic24.jpg"                      alt="joystick-mode"                ></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We hope you are no longer wondering How to change Location services on Apple iPhone 7 Plus.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN.

You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Teleporting To Another Location</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start typing your destination location and click Go</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location teleport"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Two Points</strong></p><p>Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p>You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distance gets re-calculated after each selection.

It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Asus ROG Phone 7 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Asus ROG Phone 7 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Asus ROG Phone 7 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Asus ROG Phone 7 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Asus ROG Phone 7 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Asus ROG Phone 7 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Asus ROG Phone 7 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Asus ROG Phone 7 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Asus ROG Phone 7 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Asus ROG Phone 7 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Asus ROG Phone 7 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Asus ROG Phone 7 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Asus ROG Phone 7 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Asus ROG Phone 7 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.</p><p>Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix’s Terms of Use. If you’re caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant’s Terms of Use.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?"></a>Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?</h2><p>If you’re wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don’t”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you’re connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?"></a>Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?</h2><p>There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you’re on your computer, iPhone, or Android. You can use a smart DNS service, a Proxy Server, or a <a class="link"   href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" >Tor browser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to connect to a country you want to access.

This is because Smart DNS re-routes your connection through a server in a different country. Keep in mind that Smart DNS is still a service and will require a subscription from a Smart DNS provider.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Find and select a DNS Server address from different online DNS providers.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor 70 Lite 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Honor 70 Lite 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Honor 70 Lite 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

Then you can proceed to connect your Honor 70 Lite 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Honor 70 Lite 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Apple iPhone 12 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Apple iPhone 12 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 12, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 12 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 12’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 12 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 12’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 12 device to your Apple iPhone 12.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 12 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 12 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 12 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 12 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 12 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 12 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 12 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 12 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Honor 90 GT device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Honor 90 GT Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-GT-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-GT-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 GT using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 GT using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor 90 GT location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Honor 90 GT is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Honor 90 GT device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-GT-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-GT-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 GT using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 GT using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Honor 90 GT by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Honor 90 GT by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Honor 90 GT stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Honor 90 GT device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device.

Before we get to the solutions, let’s explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:</p><ul><li>Your friend’s device has an inaccurate date</li><li>The other device isn’t connected to a network, or it’s off</li><li>Hide My Location feature is active on your friend’s phone</li><li>The Location Services are also turned off on the friend’s device</li><li>Your friend hasn’t signed in to the service</li><li>The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn’t provide this feature</li></ul><p>All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Honor 90 GT  and Android phones.

So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country&#x2F;region.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again"><a href="#Tip-2-Quit-and-enable-GPS-or-Location-Services-again" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again"></a>Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again</h3><p>After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS &amp; Location Services.

Upon successful connection, press the “Get Started” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="tap on get started button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Following that, you’ll see an area map.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 15 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 15 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 15 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 15 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity.

Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 15 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Please contact your cellular carrier and try again”. This message indicates that your phone is not connected to the internet.</p><p>As a result, your contacts, photos, and messages are not showing. Life360 may be using cellular data instead of Wi-Fi, but it’s not certain.

For example, if you have an iPhone or iPad, it may be using the same cell tower as your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p>The Life360 app has to use the closest available cell tower to determine your location. So if another device uses the closest tower, Life360 will use that instead.</p><h3 id="Poor-Signal"><a href="#Poor-Signal" class="headerlink" title="Poor Signal"></a>Poor Signal</h3><p>A poor signal in a particular region, particularly if you’re commuting, is the most common cause of Life360’s incorrect location.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Honor 100 Pro device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Honor 100 Pro Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-100-Pro-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-100-Pro-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 100 Pro using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 100 Pro using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor 100 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Honor 100 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Honor 100 Pro device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-100-Pro-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-100-Pro-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 100 Pro using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 100 Pro using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Honor 100 Pro by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Honor 100 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Honor 100 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Honor 100 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Honor 100 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Honor 100 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Honor-100-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Honor-100-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Honor 100 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Honor 100 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Honor 100 Pro app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p>You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose if you want to repeat this route and click Match to start the fun.</p><p><strong>You can watch the video below to get your location changed on your Honor 100 Pro with Wondershare Dr.Fone</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/USRZIkJaCu4"></iframe><h2 id="Part-IV-FAQs"><a href="#Part-IV-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: FAQs"></a>Part IV: FAQs</h2><p>Here are some commonly asked questions to help you with location spoofer Honor 100 Pro apps.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-Will-a-location-spoofer-Honor-100-Pro-app-damage-my-Honor-100-Pro-or-its-GPS"><a href="#FAQ-1-Will-a-location-spoofer-Honor-100-Pro-app-damage-my-Honor-100-Pro-or-its-GPS" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Honor 100 Pro app damage my Honor 100 Pro or its GPS?"></a>FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Honor 100 Pro app damage my Honor 100 Pro or its GPS?</h3><p>Not in the least.

It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Apple iPhone 11 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 11, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 11 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 11’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 11 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 11’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 11 device to your Apple iPhone 11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-11-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-11-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 11 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 11 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 11 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 11 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 11 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 11 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 11 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 11 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-11-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-11-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 11 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 11 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone SE (2020), and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone SE (2020) location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone SE (2020) is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to your Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone SE (2020) using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone SE (2020) using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone SE (2020) by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone SE (2020) by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone SE (2020) stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone SE (2020) unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone SE (2020) using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone SE (2020) using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

This is what geo-blocking means. If you want to know more about geo-blocking, you have come to the right article. This article provides the definition, symbols, function, type, and how to bypass a geo-blocked site.</p><p>Encryption is often used in geo-blocking as a means of protecting material that is restricted to users in just certain locations. In its long existence, the method has been met with several obstacles. These obstacles will be discussed in the next sections!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-academy.jpg"                      alt="what is geo blocking"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It will also show how websites inform viewers that they are in geo-blocking areas.</p><h3 id="Definition-of-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Definition-of-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Definition of Geo-Blocking"></a>Definition of Geo-Blocking</h3><p>Geo-blocking is the practice of restricting online access to certain users depending on where in the world they happen to be physically located. Telecommunications firms, websites, and other content providers and intellectual property owners often use this method for copyright protection. To monitor and enforce geo-blocks, databases that map out IP addresses’ geographical locations are often employed.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements"><a href="#Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements"></a>Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements</h3><p>You sometimes can’t access a site because it isn’t available in your area. This is the main element carried by geo-blocking.</p><p>Every online-surfing tool has a unique identifier called “IP address”. The address can identify the Apple iPhone SE (2020) devices’ geographical location. When users access a website, their devices send their IP addresses to the online servers. The servers read if the IP addresses are included in the allowed list and determine whether to allow the visitors to view the content.</p><p>The visitors usually know they are geographically limited through the website’s displayed outcomes, a poster indicating that the service is unavailable in the location. Take the geo-banned access by Airbnb as an example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/service-unavailable-in-location.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked airbnb"                ></p><p>Although Airbnb has been criticized for posing a threat to the availability of low-cost lodging in metropolitan areas, it has proven to be a useful resource for travelers. However, not everyone can use it; for instance, it is unavailable in Iran due to US sanctions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?</h2><p>When a firm, rather than a government, is responsible for geoblocking, IP addresses are often the first line of defense. Your IP address is like a street address, revealing where you live.</p><p>IP addresses are numerical identifiers that distinguish each machine on the internet. Your computer’s IP address is sent to the server of the website you visit so that it may supply the required data.</p><p>You’ll be assigned an IP address when you sign up for an Internet Service Provider. It is possible to pinpoint the location of your device using its IP address, albeit the degree of precision may vary. Websites use the IP address to determine whether you can read their content. They will thus refuse your request if you are using an IP address that’s not on their approved list.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Some home routers can generate VPN connections, but not all.</p><p>By changing your DNS address, clever DNS may alter your device’s virtual location. Smart DNS replaces your Internet provider’s DNS server. Netflix.com’s IP is not netflix.com. You’ll acquire the smart DNS provider’s transparent DNS proxy IP. Netflix thinks you’re in the US since this proxy server is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/smart-dns-proxy-working.jpg"                      alt="using smart dns for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers"><a href="#Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers"></a>Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers</h3><p>Rather than connecting you directly to the server housing the material you want, a proxy server functions as an intermediary. A proxy server does what its name implies: it acts on your behalf to get access to the data and then forwards it to you. Proxy servers, especially those in foreign countries, may be used to get around geographical restrictions.</p><p>Depending on the kind of proxy server you use, you may or may not be able to conceal your IP address when surfing the web. Proxy servers are available online and may be accessed from any web browser. Setting up a proxy server is easy, but your activity may still be vulnerable since proxies don’t secure your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/proxy-caching-illustration.jpg"                      alt="proxy servers for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3.

The Tor browser links to the Tor network, a collection of computers that collaborate to conceal your online footprint by relaying your traffic via several intermediary nodes.</p><p>Tor employs a technique called “onion routing” to conceal its users’ identities. Since more time is required to traverse these additional levels, your internet speed may suffer as a consequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/use-tor-browser-to-bypass-geo-blocking.jpg"                      alt="tor for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection"><a href="#Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 4.

Is Geo-Blocking Legal?"></a>1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?</h3><p>Yes. It’s legitimate. Limiting access to websites and services based on a user’s location is lawful. This practice is routinely used in nations like China to prevent citizens from seeing politically sensitive material. Legal arrangements, such as licensing agreements, may also be enforced by geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal"><a href="#2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?"></a>2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?</h3><p>It depends. Depending on the situation, the nation, the purpose of the use, and the technique used, geo-blocking circumvention may be against the law. Copyright regulations prohibit users from accessing material beyond its designated location, yet many providers are reluctant to penalize users for doing so.</p><h3 id="3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="3.

What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>Geo-fencing is to create digital fences on which to base real-world judgments about where to go. One may draw a boundary around it using longitude and latitude lines on a map to easily establish who is permitted inside a certain region. Restricting access to material based on a user’s physical location is called “geo-blocking.”</p><h3 id="4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?"></a>4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>They are the same. Restricting a user’s ability to access certain online resources depending on their location is known as geo-blocking or geo-restriction. To safeguard their license agreements, foreign media streaming firms often use the practice of geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>For several reasons, media and content producers use geo-blocking. Although geo-blocking is unlikely to ever go out of style, there are techniques to circumvent it. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions on the material you want to watch. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a proxy server, the Tor network, etc., your online location may be hidden or masked.</p><p>Geo-blocking controls. It’s both useful and abused.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Apple iPhone 15 Plus Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 15 Plus location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 15 Plus is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 15 Plus by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 15 Plus by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 15 Plus stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 15 Plus unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 15 Plus using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you.

You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 8 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 8 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 8 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 8 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 8 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-8-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-8-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 8 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 8 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use.

People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries.

If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option.

Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly.

You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your Apple iPhone 8&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change "                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

This is how you use Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer for GPS Spoofing iPhone.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Honor 90 Pro device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Honor 90 Pro Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-Pro-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-Pro-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 Pro using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 Pro using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor 90 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Honor 90 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Honor 90 Pro device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-Pro-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-Pro-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 Pro using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 Pro using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Honor 90 Pro by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Honor 90 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Honor 90 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Honor 90 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Honor 90 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Honor 90 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Honor-90-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Honor-90-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Honor 90 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Honor 90 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Apple iPhone XR device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Apple iPhone XR Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-XR-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-XR-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone XR using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone XR using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone XR, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone XR location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone XR’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone XR is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone XR’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone XR device to your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-XR-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-XR-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone XR using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone XR using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone XR by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone XR by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone XR stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone XR device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone XR unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones.

You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><h2 id="Ultimate-Guide-to-Free-PPTP-VPN-For-Beginners-On-Apple-iPhone-XR"><a href="#Ultimate-Guide-to-Free-PPTP-VPN-For-Beginners-On-Apple-iPhone-XR" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Apple iPhone XR"></a>Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Apple iPhone XR</h2><p>PPTP, which stands for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol is one of the oldest and most trusted ways of implementing a VPN.

Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.</p><ul><li>The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.</li><li>Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.</li><li>It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.</li><li>It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).</li><li>Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.</li><li>The tunneling is of two types in PPTP – Voluntary and Compulsory. Voluntary tunneling is initiated from the client’s end while compulsory tunneling is initiated from the server’s end. Compulsory tunneling should be supported by the router.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-1.jpg"                      alt="free pptp vpn connection"                ></p><p>By attaining a free VPN PPTP server, you can easily connect to it.

The process is quite simple and can be implemented in all the leading versions of Windows (and other operating systems). Though, there could be a slight change in the overall interface of the OS you are using. To set up free VPN PPT, follow these steps:</p><p>1. To start with, launch Control Panel and go to the Network and Sharing Center.</p><p>2. From here, you need to select the “Set up a new connection or network” option to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-2.png"                      alt="free pptp vpn connection"                ></p><p>3. This will launch a new wizard that can be used to setup a PPTP VPN free. Out of all the provided options, select the “Connect to a workplace” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-3.jpg"                      alt="connect to a workplace"                ></p><p>4. On the next window, you would be given an option to either dial directly or use a VPN. Click on the “Use my Internet Connection (VPN)” option to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-4.png"                      alt="Use my Internet Connection "                ></p><p>5. Great! Now, you need to provide information related to the host and server. You can refer the free PPTP VPN list we have provided in the previous section and pick the server (and hostname) of your choice.</p><p>6. As you would proceed to the next window, you need to provide the username and password of the PPTP VPN free you are using. The same can be obtained from our free PPTP VPN list.</p><p>7. In the end, just click on the “Create” button to use your VPN. It will be listed under the available networks.</p><p>8. Sometimes, we have to change Network Settings to make it work. To do this, just select the VPN you have created and visit its Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-5.jpg"                      alt="change nerwork settings"                ></p><p>9. Go to the Security tab and make sure the type of VPN is listed as PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol). Also, the data encryption option should be “Optional Encryption (Connect even if no encryption)” and the option for “Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)” should be selected for “Allow these protocols”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-6.jpg"                      alt="pptp vpn properties"                ></p><p>10. Furthermore, you can go to the General tab to make sure the server is specified correctly.</p><p>11. Once it is done, you can save these changes and exit the interface. Now, go to the list of available networks and connect to the free PPTP VPN you have created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/pptp-7.png"                      alt="connect to free pptp vpn"                ></p><p>That’s it!

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 13, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 13 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 13’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 13 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 13’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 13 device to your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-13-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-13-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 13 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 13 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 13 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 13 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 13 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 13 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 13 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 13 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-13-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-13-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 13 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 13 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option.

For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 13 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg"                      alt="drfone-change-location-pic-7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.</p><p>As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="change-location-registered-pic-10"                ></p><p>It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-reset-vivo-y28-5g-without-volume-buttons-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>5 Ways to Reset Vivo Y28 5G Without Volume Buttons | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/avchd-on-htc-u23-convert-mts-for-htc-u23-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mts-on-android/"><u>AVCHD on HTC U23-convert MTS for HTC U23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-pictures-files-on-honor-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Complete guide for recovering pictures files on Honor .</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-call-logs-from-honor-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - undelete lost call logs from Honor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-call-logs-from-lava-blaze-pro-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - undelete lost call logs from Lava Blaze Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-reno-9a-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>How To Bypass FRP on Reno 9A</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-undelete-lost-messages-from-lava-blaze-2-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Undelete Lost Messages from Lava Blaze 2 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/does-samsung-galaxy-s23-has-native-hevc-support-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-hevc-video-on-android/"><u>Does Samsung Galaxy S23 has native HEVC support?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-the-professionals-method-for-removing-unwanted-sounds-from-media-projects-using-premiere-pro/"><u>Updated The Professionals Method for Removing Unwanted Sounds From Media Projects Using Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-deep-dive-into-the-top-9-youtube-downloader-apps-for-android/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  A Deep Dive Into the Top 9 YouTube Downloader Apps for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unraveling-instagrams-complex-world-of-data-a-beginner-to-pro-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Unraveling Instagram's Complex World of Data  A Beginner to Pro Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-realme-gt-5-pro-pattern-lock-screen-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Realme GT 5 Pro Pattern Lock Screen Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-iconic-trailer-highlight-assortment/"><u>In 2024, Iconic Trailer Highlight Assortment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-ideal-android-video-recording-tools-ranked-five-best-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ideal Android Video Recording Tools  Ranked Five Best for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/direct-upload-how-to-share-your-favorite-fb-vids-in-chats/"><u>Direct Upload  How To Share Your Favorite FB Vids in Chats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-a-locked-nokia-c210-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Reset a Locked Nokia C210 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-send-ringtones-from-apple-iphone-12-pro-to-iphone-including-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Send Ringtones from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone Including iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 12 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 12 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 12 Pro by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 12 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 12 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 12 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 12 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Honor 90 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Honor 90 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Honor 90 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Honor 90 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Honor 90 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Honor 90 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Honor 90 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Honor 90 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Honor 90 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Honor 90 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Honor 90 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Honor-90-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Honor-90-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Honor 90 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Honor 90 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Honor-90-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Honor 90 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/joystick-mode-pic24.jpg"                      alt="joystick-mode"                ></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We hope you are no longer wondering How to change Location services on Honor 90.

You are now ready to perform techno-wizardry, relocate to another place, or even simulate movement between two points easily! Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Teleporting To Another Location</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start typing your destination location and click Go</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location teleport"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the ZTE Blade A73 5G. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Two Points</strong></p><p>Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer ZTE Blade A73 5G app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p>You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distance gets re-calculated after each selection.

If the location is not coming correctly, tap on the <strong>Center On</strong> icon present in the lower-right of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location map interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Next, in the upper-right corner, click on the teleport mode icon. Next, enter the desired location at the upper left-hand side that you wish to teleport to. Finally, click on the <strong>Go</strong> button after entering the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>.

For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.</p><h3 id="Q2-Does-Find-My-iPhone-Work-on-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Q2-Does-Find-My-iPhone-Work-on-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?"></a>Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?</h3><p>No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the ZTE Blade A73 5G device is offline, and it isn’t easy to track the ZTE Blade A73 5G device.</p><h3 id="Q3-Does-airplane-mode-turn-off-life360"><a href="#Q3-Does-airplane-mode-turn-off-life360" class="headerlink" title="Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360"></a>Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360</h3><p>Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during <strong>airplane mode, Life360</strong> will not update your site.</p><h2 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h2><p>So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, and act as an external source that will spoof the Apple iPhone 6 Plus location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Apple iPhone 6 Plus is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Apple iPhone 6 Plus by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Apple iPhone 6 Plus by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Apple iPhone 6 Plus stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Apple iPhone 6 Plus unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 6 Plus using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/joystick-mode-pic24.jpg"                      alt="joystick-mode"                ></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We hope you are no longer wondering How to change Location services on Apple iPhone 6 Plus.
