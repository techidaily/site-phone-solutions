This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Realme 12 Pro+ 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Realme 12 Pro+ 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme 12 Pro+ 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-12-Pro-5G-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/joystick-mode-pic24.jpg"                      alt="joystick-mode"                ></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We hope you are no longer wondering How to change Location services on Realme 12 Pro+ 5G.

Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Samsung Galaxy M14 4G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Samsung Galaxy M14 4G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M14-4G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy M14 4G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Samsung Galaxy M14 4G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Samsung Galaxy M14 4G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device to your Mac device.

Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/04/best-route-generator-apps-1.jpg"                      alt="Route Generator App Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Route-Generator-App-And-Why-to-Use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?"></a>Part 1: What is a Route Generator App (And Why to Use it)?</h2><p>In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.</p><p>Therefore, it can help you navigate when you hike, trail, cycle, play games like Pokemon Go, and do other activities where there is low internet connectivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Route-Generator-Apps-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try</h2><p>If you are also looking for a functioning GPX generator app for your device, then I would recommend the following options:</p><ol><li><strong>Route4Me</strong></li></ol><p>Route4Me is a dynamic GPS planner and route generator app that you can use for leading Android and iOS devices.

Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Samsung Galaxy M14 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Samsung Galaxy A14 4G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Samsung Galaxy A14 4G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Samsung Galaxy A14 4G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Samsung Galaxy A14 4G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A14-4G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A14 4G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website.

How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.</p><p>- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.</p><h2 id="Closing-Words"><a href="#Closing-Words" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Using a mock location app can be fun.

This is what geo-blocking means. If you want to know more about geo-blocking, you have come to the right article. This article provides the definition, symbols, function, type, and how to bypass a geo-blocked site.</p><p>Encryption is often used in geo-blocking as a means of protecting material that is restricted to users in just certain locations. In its long existence, the method has been met with several obstacles. These obstacles will be discussed in the next sections!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-academy.jpg"                      alt="what is geo blocking"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Geo-Blocking?"></a>Part 1. What is Geo-Blocking?</h2><p>This section will give you the definition of geo-blocking. It will also show how websites inform viewers that they are in geo-blocking areas.</p><h3 id="Definition-of-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Definition-of-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Definition of Geo-Blocking"></a>Definition of Geo-Blocking</h3><p>Geo-blocking is the practice of restricting online access to certain users depending on where in the world they happen to be physically located. Telecommunications firms, websites, and other content providers and intellectual property owners often use this method for copyright protection. To monitor and enforce geo-blocks, databases that map out IP addresses’ geographical locations are often employed.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements"><a href="#Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements"></a>Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements</h3><p>You sometimes can’t access a site because it isn’t available in your area. This is the main element carried by geo-blocking.</p><p>Every online-surfing tool has a unique identifier called “IP address”. The address can identify the Samsung Galaxy A14 4G devices’ geographical location. When users access a website, their devices send their IP addresses to the online servers. The servers read if the IP addresses are included in the allowed list and determine whether to allow the visitors to view the content.</p><p>The visitors usually know they are geographically limited through the website’s displayed outcomes, a poster indicating that the service is unavailable in the location. Take the geo-banned access by Airbnb as an example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/service-unavailable-in-location.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked airbnb"                ></p><p>Although Airbnb has been criticized for posing a threat to the availability of low-cost lodging in metropolitan areas, it has proven to be a useful resource for travelers. However, not everyone can use it; for instance, it is unavailable in Iran due to US sanctions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?</h2><p>When a firm, rather than a government, is responsible for geoblocking, IP addresses are often the first line of defense. Your IP address is like a street address, revealing where you live.</p><p>IP addresses are numerical identifiers that distinguish each machine on the internet. Your computer’s IP address is sent to the server of the website you visit so that it may supply the required data.</p><p>You’ll be assigned an IP address when you sign up for an Internet Service Provider. It is possible to pinpoint the location of your device using its IP address, albeit the degree of precision may vary. Websites use the IP address to determine whether you can read their content. They will thus refuse your request if you are using an IP address that’s not on their approved list.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Common Types of Geo-blocked Content"></a>Part 3. Common Types of Geo-blocked Content</h2><p>The difficulty stems from legal hurdles, including copyrights, licenses, and territorial disputes. Certain streaming services may not make all of their offerings accessible in all regions, or a major online shop may restrict some of their offerings to customers in just one geographic area.</p><h3 id="Youtube"><a href="#Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Youtube"></a>Youtube</h3><p>Users who upload videos can restrict access to them in certain countries. This nearly usually indicates that a business has chosen that you shouldn’t be able to see a video because of where you are located.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-blocked-assets-video-not-available.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked video on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Spotify"><a href="#Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Spotify"></a>Spotify</h3><p>You may be trying to find a method to unblock Spotify because you want to listen to unavailable music in your country or because the app has been prohibited in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/spotify-not-available-blocked-geoblock.jpg"                      alt="spotify geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Live-Sports"><a href="#Live-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Live Sports"></a>Live Sports</h3><p>Big events may be aired exclusively by one company, which means you may be forced to pay to access certain material or go through annoying subscription hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/fox-sport-geo-blocking-page.jpg"                      alt="fox sports geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Pandora"><a href="#Pandora" class="headerlink" title="Pandora"></a>Pandora</h3><p>Do you want to tune in to this online radio and music station?

Use Smart Domain Name System (DNS)</h3><p>Clever DNS can evade geoblocking if your smart TV, streaming box, or gaming console doesn’t support VPNs or proxy servers. Some home routers can generate VPN connections, but not all.</p><p>By changing your DNS address, clever DNS may alter your device’s virtual location. Smart DNS replaces your Internet provider’s DNS server. Netflix.com’s IP is not netflix.com. You’ll acquire the smart DNS provider’s transparent DNS proxy IP. Netflix thinks you’re in the US since this proxy server is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/smart-dns-proxy-working.jpg"                      alt="using smart dns for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers"><a href="#Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers"></a>Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers</h3><p>Rather than connecting you directly to the server housing the material you want, a proxy server functions as an intermediary. A proxy server does what its name implies: it acts on your behalf to get access to the data and then forwards it to you. Proxy servers, especially those in foreign countries, may be used to get around geographical restrictions.</p><p>Depending on the kind of proxy server you use, you may or may not be able to conceal your IP address when surfing the web. Proxy servers are available online and may be accessed from any web browser. Setting up a proxy server is easy, but your activity may still be vulnerable since proxies don’t secure your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/proxy-caching-illustration.jpg"                      alt="proxy servers for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use the Tor Browser"></a>Method 3. Use the Tor Browser</h3><p>In addition to using a VPN, you may use the anonymous Tor browser. The Tor browser links to the Tor network, a collection of computers that collaborate to conceal your online footprint by relaying your traffic via several intermediary nodes.</p><p>Tor employs a technique called “onion routing” to conceal its users’ identities. Since more time is required to traverse these additional levels, your internet speed may suffer as a consequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/use-tor-browser-to-bypass-geo-blocking.jpg"                      alt="tor for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection"><a href="#Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. A Good VPN Connection"></a>Method 4. A Good VPN Connection</h3><p>A virtual private network (VPN) may hide your online identity and protect your data by encrypting your connection. VPNs allow you to get around geographically restricted material by redirecting your connection via a server in another country. This will allow you to connect to VPN servers in other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/pokemon-go/spoof-pokemon-go-location-with-vpn.html" >effective VPN tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can surf the web anonymously, unblock geo-blocked content, and watch your favorite programs abroad.

Is Geo-Blocking Legal?"></a>1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?</h3><p>Yes. It’s legitimate. Limiting access to websites and services based on a user’s location is lawful. This practice is routinely used in nations like China to prevent citizens from seeing politically sensitive material. Legal arrangements, such as licensing agreements, may also be enforced by geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal"><a href="#2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?"></a>2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?</h3><p>It depends. Depending on the situation, the nation, the purpose of the use, and the technique used, geo-blocking circumvention may be against the law. Copyright regulations prohibit users from accessing material beyond its designated location, yet many providers are reluctant to penalize users for doing so.</p><h3 id="3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?"></a>3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>Geo-fencing is to create digital fences on which to base real-world judgments about where to go. One may draw a boundary around it using longitude and latitude lines on a map to easily establish who is permitted inside a certain region. Restricting access to material based on a user’s physical location is called “geo-blocking.”</p><h3 id="4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?"></a>4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>They are the same. Restricting a user’s ability to access certain online resources depending on their location is known as geo-blocking or geo-restriction. To safeguard their license agreements, foreign media streaming firms often use the practice of geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>For several reasons, media and content producers use geo-blocking. Although geo-blocking is unlikely to ever go out of style, there are techniques to circumvent it. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions on the material you want to watch. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a proxy server, the Tor network, etc., your online location may be hidden or masked.</p><p>Geo-blocking controls. It’s both useful and abused. Website banning discriminates and manipulates. Geography may be annoying and frustrating. Sadly, they may always be in style. You don’t have to tolerate them!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-oppo-reno-10-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Watch Hulu Outside US On Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-infinix-note-30-vip-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>How To Bypass FRP on Infinix Note 30 VIP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-videos-from-galaxy-a15-4g-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted videos from Galaxy A15 4G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-t-play-mp4-files-on-samsung-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mp4-on-android/"><u>Can't play MP4 files on Samsung </u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-motorola-edgeplus-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Watch Hulu Outside US On Motorola Edge+ (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-motorola-edge-2023-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted photos from Motorola Edge 2023.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/device-unlock-honor-100-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Device unlock  Honor 100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-i-view-avchd-mts-files-on-htc-u23-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mts-on-android/"><u>Can I view AVCHD .mts files on HTC U23?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/fixed-were-sorry-but-excel-has-run-into-an-error-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Fixed Were Sorry But Excel Has Run into an Error</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-easy-solutions-to-hard-reset-samsung-galaxy-a05-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Easy Solutions to Hard Reset Samsung Galaxy A05 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-explore-instagrams-per-video-limit-explained/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Explore Instagram's Per-Video Limit Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-funimate-decoded-a-step-by-step-journey/"><u>In 2024, Funimate Decoded  A Step-by-Step Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-unmatched-tools-apart-from-obs-for-broadcasting/"><u>[New] Unmatched Tools Apart From OBS for Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-live-broadcasts-with-premium-webcams/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhancing Live Broadcasts with Premium WebCams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-art-of-minimizing-lag-with-additional-ram-for-minecraft/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Art of Minimizing Lag with Additional RAM for Minecraft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-portrait-to-panorama-a-guide-to-instagrams-rotation-revolution/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Portrait to Panorama  A Guide to Instagram's Rotation Revolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-harness-your-screen-with-screencastify-recorder-for-2024/"><u>[New] Harness Your Screen with Screencastify Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-vivo-y55s-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/undelete-lost-pictures-from-oppo-reno-10-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Undelete lost pictures from Oppo Reno 10 5G.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-stepwise-approach-for-creating-an-interactive-skype-conversation-among-users-from-multiple-operating-systems/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Stepwise Approach for Creating an Interactive Skype Conversation Among Users From Multiple Operating Systems</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Poco F5 Pro 5G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Poco F5 Pro 5G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Poco F5 Pro 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Poco F5 Pro 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Poco F5 Pro 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Poco F5 Pro 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Poco F5 Pro 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Poco F5 Pro 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Poco F5 Pro 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Poco F5 Pro 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Poco F5 Pro 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Poco F5 Pro 5G using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another. This is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Location Handle app from the website or App store</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-handler-cydia-pic20.jpg"                      alt="location handler cydia"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: There are four different types - Normal Mode - teleport to a new location; Offset Mode - Move a few feet away from the present location ; Automatic Mode - Slowly change your location from one point to another, as if walking ; Manual Mode - Change your location using a joystick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/teleport-coordination-pic21.jpg"                      alt="teleport-coordination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Consider the Manual mode, because we want to change location to a far-off place and not necessarily for gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/manual-mode-location-handle-pic22.jpg"                      alt="manual mode location handle"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the Manual mode is activated, the map will be displayed and you can change the pin location. You can enter the location name in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/chowchilla-location-handler-pic23.jpg"                      alt="chowchilla location handler"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: The Joystick will appear on the page and you can use it to shift your location to wherever you want. Once you fix on the location, proceed and the new location will be updated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/joystick-mode-pic24.jpg"                      alt="joystick-mode"                ></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We hope you are no longer wondering How to change Location services on Poco F5 Pro 5G.

Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Teleporting To Another Location</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the crosshairs icon at the top right to activate Teleport Mode</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start typing your destination location and click Go</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location teleport"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will get a popup to confirm. Click Move Here, and your location will change to reflect the chosen location. Now on, in all supported location-based apps, you will see your chosen location until you restart the Poco F5 Pro 5G. This allows you to break the paywall of dating apps, too, as they will see your current location as the location you chose, allowing you to find dates outside the boundaries set by the apps for free.</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Two Points</strong></p><p>Want to catch Pokémon on the streets of Vermont in the United States while relaxing on your couch in Tasmania, Australia? Wonderful idea! Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Virtual Location spoofer Poco F5 Pro 5G app to simulate movement such as walking the streets and catching more Pokémon:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the Virtual Location interface, click the middle icon at the top right (which looks like inverted S) to symbolize movement simulation between two points.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Type your destination and click Go.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A popup shows the distance of the place from your current location (spoofed).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Dr.Fone Virtual Location allows you to choose the simulation speed – you can select walking, cycling and a four-wheeler to simulate those speeds. Click Move Here.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a new popup, choose if you want to route to repeat and select the number of times. Click Match to start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location two point simulation"                ></p><p>You should now see your location dot moving along your chosen route at the speed you selected. Open Pokémon Go and start catching!</p><p><strong>Simulating Movement Between Multiple Points</strong></p><p>Similarly, you can simulate between multiple points to play elaborate pranks on your friends and family. If you simply spoof your location to another point as shown previously, they might not believe it. But, if you show movement from one location to another, they can’t deny that, can they? This movement simulation also helps with games such as Pokémon GO.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the icon at the top right (looks like italicized N)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start clicking the points you want to simulate movement from and through. NOTE: Simulate movements as would happen in real life otherwise game algorithms will catch up and you are liable to get banned for cheating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distance gets re-calculated after each selection. When you are satisfied with your route simulation, click Move Here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="drfone virtual location multi point simulation"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose if you want to repeat this route and click Match to start the fun.</p><p><strong>You can watch the video below to get your location changed on your Poco F5 Pro 5G with Wondershare Dr.Fone</strong></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/USRZIkJaCu4"></iframe><h2 id="Part-IV-FAQs"><a href="#Part-IV-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: FAQs"></a>Part IV: FAQs</h2><p>Here are some commonly asked questions to help you with location spoofer Poco F5 Pro 5G apps.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-Will-a-location-spoofer-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-app-damage-my-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-or-its-GPS"><a href="#FAQ-1-Will-a-location-spoofer-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-app-damage-my-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-or-its-GPS" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Poco F5 Pro 5G app damage my Poco F5 Pro 5G or its GPS?"></a>FAQ 1: Will a location spoofer Poco F5 Pro 5G app damage my Poco F5 Pro 5G or its GPS?</h3><p>Not in the least.

Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Samsung Galaxy A05 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Samsung Galaxy A05 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy A05 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Samsung Galaxy A05 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Samsung Galaxy A05 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy A05 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Samsung Galaxy A05 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Samsung Galaxy A05 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A05 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A05 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A05 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A05 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

These obstacles will be discussed in the next sections!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-academy.jpg"                      alt="what is geo blocking"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Geo-Blocking?"></a>Part 1. What is Geo-Blocking?</h2><p>This section will give you the definition of geo-blocking. It will also show how websites inform viewers that they are in geo-blocking areas.</p><h3 id="Definition-of-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Definition-of-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Definition of Geo-Blocking"></a>Definition of Geo-Blocking</h3><p>Geo-blocking is the practice of restricting online access to certain users depending on where in the world they happen to be physically located. Telecommunications firms, websites, and other content providers and intellectual property owners often use this method for copyright protection. To monitor and enforce geo-blocks, databases that map out IP addresses’ geographical locations are often employed.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements"><a href="#Understanding-the-Main-Symbols-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements"></a>Understanding the Main Symbols and Elements</h3><p>You sometimes can’t access a site because it isn’t available in your area. This is the main element carried by geo-blocking.</p><p>Every online-surfing tool has a unique identifier called “IP address”. The address can identify the Samsung Galaxy A05 devices’ geographical location. When users access a website, their devices send their IP addresses to the online servers. The servers read if the IP addresses are included in the allowed list and determine whether to allow the visitors to view the content.</p><p>The visitors usually know they are geographically limited through the website’s displayed outcomes, a poster indicating that the service is unavailable in the location. Take the geo-banned access by Airbnb as an example below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/service-unavailable-in-location.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked airbnb"                ></p><p>Although Airbnb has been criticized for posing a threat to the availability of low-cost lodging in metropolitan areas, it has proven to be a useful resource for travelers. However, not everyone can use it; for instance, it is unavailable in Iran due to US sanctions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Geo-Blocking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Geo-Blocking Work?</h2><p>When a firm, rather than a government, is responsible for geoblocking, IP addresses are often the first line of defense. Your IP address is like a street address, revealing where you live.</p><p>IP addresses are numerical identifiers that distinguish each machine on the internet. Your computer’s IP address is sent to the server of the website you visit so that it may supply the required data.</p><p>You’ll be assigned an IP address when you sign up for an Internet Service Provider. It is possible to pinpoint the location of your device using its IP address, albeit the degree of precision may vary. Websites use the IP address to determine whether you can read their content. They will thus refuse your request if you are using an IP address that’s not on their approved list.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Types-of-Geo-blocked-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Common Types of Geo-blocked Content"></a>Part 3. Common Types of Geo-blocked Content</h2><p>The difficulty stems from legal hurdles, including copyrights, licenses, and territorial disputes. Certain streaming services may not make all of their offerings accessible in all regions, or a major online shop may restrict some of their offerings to customers in just one geographic area.</p><h3 id="Youtube"><a href="#Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Youtube"></a>Youtube</h3><p>Users who upload videos can restrict access to them in certain countries. This nearly usually indicates that a business has chosen that you shouldn’t be able to see a video because of where you are located.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/youtube-blocked-assets-video-not-available.jpg"                      alt="geo blocked video on youtube"                ></p><h3 id="Spotify"><a href="#Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Spotify"></a>Spotify</h3><p>You may be trying to find a method to unblock Spotify because you want to listen to unavailable music in your country or because the app has been prohibited in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/spotify-not-available-blocked-geoblock.jpg"                      alt="spotify geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Live-Sports"><a href="#Live-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Live Sports"></a>Live Sports</h3><p>Big events may be aired exclusively by one company, which means you may be forced to pay to access certain material or go through annoying subscription hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/fox-sport-geo-blocking-page.jpg"                      alt="fox sports geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Pandora"><a href="#Pandora" class="headerlink" title="Pandora"></a>Pandora</h3><p>Do you want to tune in to this online radio and music station?

Some porn sites have been outlawed in several countries, including Egypt and Pakistan, where the vast majority of the population resides.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/pornhub-geoblock-error-message.jpg"                      alt="pornhub geo blocked"                ></p><h3 id="Amazon"><a href="#Amazon" class="headerlink" title="Amazon"></a>Amazon</h3><p>Amazon Prime geo-blocks other services as well as its streaming content. Games, ebooks, software, audiobooks, and other digital materials like TV and movies may be licensed and copyrighted. Amazon Prime prevents certain VPN IPs from accessing foreign content, including Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/amazon-prime-vpn-not-working.jpg"                      alt="amazon prime video vpn not working"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-Bypass-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-Bypass-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Tips to Bypass Geo-Blocking"></a>Part 4. Tips to Bypass Geo-Blocking</h2><p>While certain sites may be blocked in your country, there are still methods to access the full functionality of the web. What exactly are they, and how do you go about getting them? Here’s more reading material.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Smart-Domain-Name-System-DNS"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Smart-Domain-Name-System-DNS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Use Smart Domain Name System (DNS)"></a>Method 1. Use Smart Domain Name System (DNS)</h3><p>Clever DNS can evade geoblocking if your smart TV, streaming box, or gaming console doesn’t support VPNs or proxy servers. Some home routers can generate VPN connections, but not all.</p><p>By changing your DNS address, clever DNS may alter your device’s virtual location. Smart DNS replaces your Internet provider’s DNS server. Netflix.com’s IP is not netflix.com. You’ll acquire the smart DNS provider’s transparent DNS proxy IP. Netflix thinks you’re in the US since this proxy server is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/smart-dns-proxy-working.jpg"                      alt="using smart dns for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers"><a href="#Method-2-Connect-to-Proxy-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers"></a>Method 2. Connect to Proxy Servers</h3><p>Rather than connecting you directly to the server housing the material you want, a proxy server functions as an intermediary. A proxy server does what its name implies: it acts on your behalf to get access to the data and then forwards it to you. Proxy servers, especially those in foreign countries, may be used to get around geographical restrictions.</p><p>Depending on the kind of proxy server you use, you may or may not be able to conceal your IP address when surfing the web. Proxy servers are available online and may be accessed from any web browser. Setting up a proxy server is easy, but your activity may still be vulnerable since proxies don’t secure your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/proxy-caching-illustration.jpg"                      alt="proxy servers for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-Tor-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use the Tor Browser"></a>Method 3. Use the Tor Browser</h3><p>In addition to using a VPN, you may use the anonymous Tor browser. The Tor browser links to the Tor network, a collection of computers that collaborate to conceal your online footprint by relaying your traffic via several intermediary nodes.</p><p>Tor employs a technique called “onion routing” to conceal its users’ identities. Since more time is required to traverse these additional levels, your internet speed may suffer as a consequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/use-tor-browser-to-bypass-geo-blocking.jpg"                      alt="tor for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection"><a href="#Method-4-A-Good-VPN-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. A Good VPN Connection"></a>Method 4. A Good VPN Connection</h3><p>A virtual private network (VPN) may hide your online identity and protect your data by encrypting your connection. VPNs allow you to get around geographically restricted material by redirecting your connection via a server in another country. This will allow you to connect to VPN servers in other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, or Australia.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/pokemon-go/spoof-pokemon-go-location-with-vpn.html" >effective VPN tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can surf the web anonymously, unblock geo-blocked content, and watch your favorite programs abroad. There are several advantages to utilizing a VPN, particularly when you travel or use public Wi-Fi, and they are simple to set up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/vpn-working-principle.jpg"                      alt="vpn for geo blocked sites"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQs-About-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#Part-5-FAQs-About-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. FAQs About Geo-Blocking"></a>Part 5. FAQs About Geo-Blocking</h2><p>Here are the answers to four questions that you might ask about geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal"><a href="#1-Is-Geo-Blocking-Legal" class="headerlink" title="1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?"></a>1. Is Geo-Blocking Legal?</h3><p>Yes. It’s legitimate. Limiting access to websites and services based on a user’s location is lawful. This practice is routinely used in nations like China to prevent citizens from seeing politically sensitive material. Legal arrangements, such as licensing agreements, may also be enforced by geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal"><a href="#2-Is-Bypassing-Geo-Blocking-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?"></a>2. Is Bypassing Geo Blocking Illegal?</h3><p>It depends. Depending on the situation, the nation, the purpose of the use, and the technique used, geo-blocking circumvention may be against the law. Copyright regulations prohibit users from accessing material beyond its designated location, yet many providers are reluctant to penalize users for doing so.</p><h3 id="3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#3-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Geo-Fencing-and-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?"></a>3. What’s the Difference Between Geo-Fencing and Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>Geo-fencing is to create digital fences on which to base real-world judgments about where to go. One may draw a boundary around it using longitude and latitude lines on a map to easily establish who is permitted inside a certain region. Restricting access to material based on a user’s physical location is called “geo-blocking.”</p><h3 id="4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking"><a href="#4-Is-Geo-Restricted-the-Same-as-Geo-Blocking" class="headerlink" title="4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?"></a>4. Is Geo-Restricted the Same as Geo-Blocking?</h3><p>They are the same. Restricting a user’s ability to access certain online resources depending on their location is known as geo-blocking or geo-restriction. To safeguard their license agreements, foreign media streaming firms often use the practice of geo-blocking.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>For several reasons, media and content producers use geo-blocking. Although geo-blocking is unlikely to ever go out of style, there are techniques to circumvent it. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions on the material you want to watch. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), a proxy server, the Tor network, etc., your online location may be hidden or masked.</p><p>Geo-blocking controls. It’s both useful and abused. Website banning discriminates and manipulates. Geography may be annoying and frustrating. Sadly, they may always be in style. You don’t have to tolerate them!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-restart-motorola-defy-2-without-power-button-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>5 Ways to Restart Motorola Defy 2 Without Power Button | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-pictures-from-a05s-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Retrieve Lost Pictures from A05s.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-lava-blaze-2-5g-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>How To Bypass FRP on Lava Blaze 2 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-call-history-from-oppo-a18-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted call history from Oppo A18</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/gionee-f3-pro-tutorial-bypass-lock-screen-security-password-pin-fingerprint-pattern-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Gionee F3 Pro Tutorial - Bypass Lock Screen,Security Password Pin,Fingerprint,Pattern</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-vivo-t2-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to use Snapchat Location Spoofer to Protect Your Privacy On Vivo T2 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ispoofer-is-not-working-on-samsung-galaxy-a14-4g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iSpoofer is not working On Samsung Galaxy A14 4G?

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme C51 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Realme C51 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme C51 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C51-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C51-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C51 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C51 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Realme C51 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme C51 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme C51 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme C51 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme C51 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme C51 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-C51-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-C51-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme C51 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme C51 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so <strong>Firefox spoof location</strong> can resolve your concerns.</p><p>It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to <strong>fake a location in Firefox</strong> on devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg"                      alt="firefox featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox"><a href="#Part-1-Preparations-Before-Spoofing-Your-Location-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox"></a>Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox</h2><p>Before starting with <strong>Firefox location spoof</strong>, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.</p><h3 id="1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API"><a href="#1-Basic-Understanding-of-the-HTML5-Geolocation-API" class="headerlink" title="1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API"></a>1. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API</h3><p>Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user’s location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can’t use this API for location determination.</p><h3 id="2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work"><a href="#2-How-Does-HTML5-Geolocation-Work" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?"></a>2. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?</h3><p>HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn’t have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Realme C51 device’s location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers"></a>Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers</h2><p>Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox"><a href="#Method-1-Disable-Geolocation-in-Firefox" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox"></a>Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox</h3><p>If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the “Three Vertical Bars” icon to select “Settings.” Now, tap “Privacy &amp; Security” from the left sidebar and navigate to “Permissions.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg"                      alt="access privacy and security"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click “Settings” in front of “Location” to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between “Remove Web Site” or “Remove All Web Sites” to remove their location access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg"                      alt="remove the specific or all websites"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the “Block new requests asking to access your location” option. Once selected, click “Save Changes” to disable your geolocation on Firefox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the block new option"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location"><a href="#Method-2-Manually-Change-Your-Firefox-Location" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location"></a>Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location</h3><p>Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That’s why it is better to <strong>spoof the location on Firefox</strong> rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type “about:config” and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the “Accept the Risk and Continue” button to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg"                      alt="hit the accept the risk button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> First search for “Geo.enabled,” and when it appears, toggle its value from “True” to “False” to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for “geo.provider.network.url” and press the “Pen” icon to edit it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on the edit button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:</p><p><strong>“data:application&#x2F;json,{“location”: {“lat”: LATITUDE VALUE, “lng”: LONGITUDE VALUE}, “accuracy”: 27000.0}.”</strong></p><p>Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg"                      alt="add your fake firefox location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension"><a href="#Method-3-Use-The-Location-Guard-Firefox-Extension" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension"></a>Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension</h3><p>Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the “<a class="link"   href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/" >Location Guard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“ add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add “Location Guard” and use it to alter your location are following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click on the “Three Vertical Bars” icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select “Add-ons and themes.” Tap “Extensions” from the left sidebar and search for “Location Guard” in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click “Add to Firefox” to add it to your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg"                      alt="add the extension to firefox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can choose between two options to protect your location’s privacy. Using the “Privacy Levels” option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg"                      alt="set the privacy levels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using its “Fixed Location” feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the “Marker” on it to change your browser’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg"                      alt="set the fixed location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-Your-Location-in-Mozilla-Firefox-on-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones"></a>Part 3: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Phones</h2><p>It is not only on computers where you can use Firefox fake location but also on smartphones.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Realme GT 5 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Realme GT 5 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-GT-5-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-GT-5-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme GT 5 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme GT 5 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme GT 5 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Realme GT 5 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme GT 5 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-GT-5-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-GT-5-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme GT 5 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme GT 5 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Realme GT 5 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme GT 5 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme GT 5 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme GT 5 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme GT 5 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme GT 5 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-GT-5-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-GT-5-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme GT 5 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme GT 5 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location.

You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C33-2023-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C33-2023-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C33 2023 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C33 2023 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Realme C33 2023 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme C33 2023 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme C33 2023 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme C33 2023 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme C33 2023 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme C33 2023 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-C33-2023-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-C33-2023-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme C33 2023 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme C33 2023 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone. If you don’t know how to do it or do not want to take the risk, Cydia’s LocationFaker app may not be the right fit for you. But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C33-2023-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C33-2023-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme C33 2023 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme C33 2023 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Realme C67 4G device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Realme C67 4G Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C67-4G-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C67-4G-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme C67 4G using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Realme C67 4G using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme C67 4G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Realme C67 4G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme C67 4G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C67-4G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-C67-4G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C67 4G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme C67 4G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Realme C67 4G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme C67 4G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme C67 4G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme C67 4G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts.

You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Poco X6 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Poco X6 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Poco X6 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Poco X6 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Poco X6 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Poco X6 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-X6-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-X6-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco X6 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco X6 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.</p><p>Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix’s Terms of Use. If you’re caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant’s Terms of Use.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?"></a>Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?</h2><p>If you’re wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don’t”.

This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Poco C65 device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Poco C65 Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-C65-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-C65-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Poco C65 using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Poco C65 using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Poco C65 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Poco C65 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Poco C65 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-C65-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-C65-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco C65 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco C65 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Poco C65 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Poco C65 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Poco C65 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme GT 3 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Realme GT 3 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme GT 3 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option.

That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme GT 3 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme GT 3 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme GT 3 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme GT 3 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme GT 3 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-GT-3-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-GT-3-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme GT 3 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme GT 3 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Realme Narzo N55 location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Realme Narzo N55 is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Realme Narzo N55 device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-Narzo-N55-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-Narzo-N55-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme Narzo N55 using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Realme Narzo N55 using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Realme Narzo N55 by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Realme Narzo N55 by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Realme Narzo N55 stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Realme Narzo N55 device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Realme Narzo N55 unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Realme Narzo N55 as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-Narzo-N55-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Realme-Narzo-N55-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme Narzo N55 using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Realme Narzo N55 using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-Narzo-N55-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Realme-Narzo-N55-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme Narzo N55 using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Realme Narzo N55 using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

You can call it a two-way - give and take relationship when it comes to the dynamics of data exchange between the world wide web and the users.</p><p>When you visit websites, they use cookies to track your activities. When you visit a restaurant, the phone detects and saves the GPS in the memory. You click a picture in the Maldives, your phone seeks out geographic points to prepare the right time and date stamps.</p><p>You need your GPS to download and use certain apps. Similarly, your GPS might be the reason you are unable to play some games or use some applications. Change GPS Location Poco X6 Pro and this won’t be a problem for you.</p><p>But if you are wondering how can I change my location on my iPhone?

One of the best options in the market is Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. This is how you use Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer for GPS Spoofing iPhone.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This is easily available when you google it or you can also follow this link <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>here</u></a>. Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Poco X6 Pro device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Poco X6 Pro Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-Pro-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-Pro-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 Pro using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 Pro using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Poco X6 Pro location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Poco X6 Pro is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Poco X6 Pro device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-Pro-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Poco-X6-Pro-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 Pro using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Poco X6 Pro using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Poco X6 Pro by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Poco X6 Pro by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Poco X6 Pro stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Poco X6 Pro device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Poco X6 Pro unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Poco X6 Pro as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-X6-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Poco-X6-Pro-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco X6 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Poco X6 Pro using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Samsung Galaxy A54 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Samsung Galaxy A54 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A54-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing.

Then you can download the executive file, install and then launch the application. Once the home page opens, you will find several options - Opt for ‘Virtual Location’. It is usually at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now take your Oppo Reno 8T device and connect it to the computer that has Dr. Fone. Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option. It moves your Pin from your present location to your new virtual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a way to change Oppo Reno 8T Location without Jailbreak, then this is one of the safest options for you. Also, you have other additional features like Phone Transfer, and Whatsapp Transfer along with Location spoofing. The application will never go to waste, won’t occupy much of your computer&#x2F;PC&#x2F;Laptop’s space and you can get the fake location iOS within minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-using-External-Device"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-using-External-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T using External Device"></a>Part 2: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T using External Device</h2><p>You can achieve the iOS Spoof Location using External devices as well. These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo Reno 8T location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo Reno 8T is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Reno 8T device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo Reno 8T by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo Reno 8T by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo Reno 8T stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo Reno 8T device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo Reno 8T unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo Reno 8T as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Reno 8T using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Reno 8T using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

If you are one of those players who have been to all the local PokeStops in hopes of finding your favorite rare Pokémon, then it might be time for you to consider spoofing your location while playing PoGo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go"                ></p><p>Pokémon Go relies on GPS coordinates and real-time tracking to let players catch Pokémon s in real locations. Hence, spoofing comes to the discussion of “catching them all.”</p><p>‘Spoofing’ location makes your phone, and thereby the game thinks that you’re in another location, which opens up the possibility to catch new and rare Pokémon s from gyms and PokeStops around the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Pgsharp-legal" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?"></a><strong>Part 1: Is Pgsharp legal?</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>No game developer likes to see their game played in unfair ways. Thus, Niantic (PoGo’s Dev) made some strict rules against exploiting their game, giving some players an unfair advantage over others.</p><p>So, <strong><strong>is PGSharp legal?</strong></strong> No, Spoofing location, in general, is illegal. Hence, any apps like PGSharp, or Fake GPS Go, used to disguise actual real-time location and fake it, will result in an account ban.</p><p> According to Niantic’s terms and conditions:</p><ul><li>“Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).</li><li>And _”_Accessing Services in an unauthorized manner (including using modified or unofficial third party software).”</li></ul><p> If Niantic detects usage of a fake location or GPS spoofing app while playing Pokémon Go, they will impose a strike on your account.</p><ul><li>The first strike would make rare Pokémon s not visible to you for seven days.</li><li>The second strike would temporarily ban you from playing the game for 30 Days.</li><li>The third strike will permanently ban your account.</li></ul><p> You can appeal these strikes to Niantic if you think you’ve been banned without violation of any terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/niantic-warning.jpg"                      alt="niantic-warning"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Three-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2: Three ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><ol><li><strong>PGSharp :</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp-interface.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp-interface"                ></p><p>PGSharp is one of the most reliable ways to spoof your location while playing Pokémon Go. Niantic does not easily recognize its simple map-like UI as a fake location app.</p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> It is recommended not to use your main account while spoofing; rather, you should use your PTC (Pokémon Trainer Club) account.</p><ul><li>To spoof the location with PGSharp, go to Google’s “Play store,” search “PGSharp,” and install it.</li><li>After installation, there are two versions: Free and Paid. For trying the app with the free version, a beta key is not required anymore, while for the paid version, a key from the developer is required.</li><li>For the paid key, visit PGSharp’s official website and generate a license key.</li></ul><p>You must note that it may take two or more tries to generate a working key, and often it may show an “out of stock.” message.</p><ul><li>After opening the app and applying the key, you can spoof the location with ease.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> You may need to allow “Mock location” from debugging options. For this, go to “Settings,” then to “About Phone,” then you need to tap on “Build number” seven times to enable developer’s mode, and finally go to “Debugging” to allow “Mock location.”</p><ol start="2"><li><strong><strong>Fake GPS Go:</strong></strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/fake-gps-go.jpg"                      alt="fake gps go"                ></p><p>Fake GPS Go is another location spoofer app for Android that is reliable and free. This app allows you to fake your real-time location and enables you to spoof it to any place in the world.

Moreover, this app does not even require root access.</p><ul><li>To install Fake GPS Go, go to Google’s “Play store,” search “Fake GPS Go,” and install it.</li><li>Then, go to your phone’s “Settings” and then “System” followed by “About Phone,” and tap on the “Build Number” 7 times to enable the Developer Options.</li><li>Then you need to go to “Debugging” in “Developers Options” to allow “Mock location.”</li><li>And then, you can use this app to not only spoof your location but virtually walk around a route at a designated pace to make it look as real as possible for being undetected by developers like Niantic.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong>VPN:</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/vpn.jpg"                      alt="vpn"                ></p><p>Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) App is the safest option to spoof your location while playing PoGo, as it masks your IP address and uses a server in any other location.</p><p>Moreover, some VPNs would also encrypt your data, so it would not be easy for Game Devs to track it.</p><ul><li>To install a VPN, go to Google’s “Play store,” search the VPN of your choice and install it.</li><li>Close the Pokémon Go app from running in the background to prevent detection of the VPN.</li><li>Now, select a location server to any place before opening the PoGo app again.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> Some Free VPNs only mask your IP address and do not spoof your location, nor do they encrypt your data.

However, there is a solution. Dr.Fone comes to the rescue with their Virtual Location tool that works seamlessly. This program is easy to use and allows you to simulate your location between 2 and multiple spots with ease. Apart from that you can teleport anywhere with ease. Let us know how this tool works.</p><p>Step 1: Download the tool on your PC from the official website of drfone. Select “Virtual Location” given on the first page of the program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, have your iPhone connected to your computer. Then select “Get Started”. Now a map will open in a new window, showing your actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Enable the “teleport mode” by the third icon in the right-upper corner of the map. Then, enter the location you want to spoof your phone’s GPS to in the text box in the map’s left-upper section. Select “Go”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now select “Move here.” And you will have successfully spoofed your location on your iOS device. To confirm, open the maps app on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Pro-Tips:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Do not spoof or change location very frequently, as this might raise suspicion to the Game Dev (Niantic), and the account may get terminated, stating violation of terms.</li><li>Do not use spoofing too frequently. The best way to not get your account suspended is to replicate actual travel patterns.</li><li>Please select a new spoof location and scout it for a couple of days before going to a close-by spoof location. After you are done with the country in the spoof-location, you can move on to neighboring countries before returning to your original location (i.e., switching off the spoof.)</li><li>After you are done with your gaming, always remember to close the game from the background before turning off the spoof location.</li><li>Do not always play with the spoof location. Play with your original location for a couple of weeks before spoofing your location.</li><li>Do not spoof location to countries on different continents within a short time.</li></ul><p>Following these tips will help you to behave like an actual traveler who’s on a Pokémon hunt. This will make it even harder for game devs to detect any discrepancies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-oppo-find-x7-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Oppo Find X7 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-special-features-virtual-location-on-motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Use Special Features - Virtual Location On Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-vivo-s17e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Vivo S17e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-easy-solutions-to-hard-reset-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Easy Solutions to Hard Reset Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-vivo-y28-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Vivo Y28 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ispoofer-is-not-working-on-oppo-reno-9a-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iSpoofer is not working On Oppo Reno 9A?

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Samsung Galaxy A15 4G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A15-4G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A15-4G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Samsung Galaxy A15 4G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Samsung Galaxy A15 4G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A15-4G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A15-4G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

It lets you update your location on a map, so that you can know who else (in your friends circle) is in the same concert or attending the same seminar. Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device.

This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it.

So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server.

Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.</p><h2 id="6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-A15-4G"><a href="#6-Ways-to-Change-Spotify-Location-On-Your-Samsung-Galaxy-A15-4G" class="headerlink" title="6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G"></a>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png"                      alt="change location"                ></p><p>Spotify’s booming audio business is proof that people are in love with its services.

However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.</p><p>The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesn’t support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Tools-to-Fake-GPS-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone"></a><strong>Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone</strong></h2><p>Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content.

Once you have both of them ready, connect the Samsung Galaxy M34 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M34-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M34-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy M34 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy M34 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Samsung Galaxy M34 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Samsung Galaxy M34 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M34-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Samsung-Galaxy-M34-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy M34 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Samsung Galaxy M34 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

Then click on ‘Get Started’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, the world map will display on the screen and you can clearly see the coordinates and directions as well. On the top right corner, the third icon is called the ‘Teleport Mode’. Click on that and enter the name of the place in the search box. You can even pinpoint it, if you are sure about the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If you are completely sure that you got the address right, click on the ‘Move Here’ option.

These devices do not cause any inconvenience to you. They are meant to be small, fit into the lightning port of your iPhone, and act as an external source that will spoof the Oppo Reno 8T 5G location and the same will reflect in every app that uses or detects your iPhone’s geographic location.</p><p>The best external device to change phone location Oppo Reno 8T 5G is Double Location Dongle. This simple device can be utilized by following the steps below -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The Double Location Dongle is a very small, white rectangle that connects to your iPhone’s port. But along with it, you also have to install the Companion app for location spoofing. Once you have both of them ready, connect the Oppo Reno 8T 5G device to your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/double-location-dongle-device-pic5.jpg"                      alt="double location dongle"                ></p><p>Note: The Companion App is not available on the App store. You have to download it from Double Location’s official website.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The next step is to open the Double Location iOS companion app and then settle on the Map Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/companion-app-double-location-map-pic6.jpg"                      alt="companion app double location map"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Unlike what we had seen in the Dr. Fone step, we cannot enter the location into any search box. You should move the pin to the location that you want to virtually shift to. Double Location provides some very good options that will help you during gaming. You can change all the appropriate settings and proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-dongle-settings-pic7.jpg"                      alt="change location setting"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: On the bottom of the screen, Go for the lock position option. Once you do that, there will be a virtual shift in your geographic position and all your apps will register your new coordinates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/final-map-location-pic8.jpg"                      alt="final map location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-5G-using-XCode"><a href="#Part-3-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-5G-using-XCode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T 5G using XCode"></a>Part 3: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T 5G using XCode</h2><p>You can change the geolocation Oppo Reno 8T 5G by using your coding expertise as well. That is why XCode exists. This Computer Program lets you change your Location in Oppo Reno 8T 5G by giving some GIT Commands to the PC while your Oppo Reno 8T 5G stays connected to it. By following these steps, you can understand how to do it. But if you’ve never had a liking for programming and coding languages, then you should probably skip this -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install XCode from the AppStore, directly to your Mac device. Launch the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/download-and-install-xcode-pic9.jpg"                      alt="download xcode app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you see the XCode window open, Go for the ‘Single View Application’ to start a new Project and go on by clicking on ‘Next’. You can set up a name and details for this particular project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/single-view-application-project-pic10.jpg"                      alt="single view application project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: A screen display will appear asking you about your identity. This is where the minimal coding part starts. You need to enter some GIT Commands to continue with the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/identify-yourself-pic11.jpg"                      alt="identify yourself"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch and run the terminal on your Mac device and enter these commands - git config –global user.email “<a href="mailto:you@example.com"><u>you@example.com</u></a>“ and git config –global user. name “your name”.You need to add your own details in the quoted space and continue to verify your identity.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Once you enter the commands, go to the next step and establish the Development Team. Then you can proceed to connect your Oppo Reno 8T 5G device to your Mac device. Use the normal cable to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iphone-connects-to-mac-pic13.jpg"                      alt="iphone connects to mac"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: To allow the program to process the Symbol Files, you will have to choose the model of your device. Go to the ‘Build Device’ option and continue as per the prompts. However, make sure that you keep your Oppo Reno 8T 5G unlocked for quick detection by the computer software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/process-detection-on-iphone-pic14.jpg"                      alt="process-detection-on-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Once that is done, you can come back to the actual location spoofing part. Go to the debug Menu &gt; Simulation Location and specify the exact location that you want to virtually shift to. Once you are okay with it, the same will reflect on your Oppo Reno 8T 5G as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-virtual-location-xcode-pic15.jpg"                      alt="new virtual location xcode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App"><a href="#Part-4-Change-GPS-location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-5G-using-Cydia-Location-Faker-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Reno 8T 5G using Cydia Location Faker App"></a>Part 4: Change GPS location on Oppo Reno 8T 5G using Cydia Location Faker App</h2><p>Cydia is also based on software applications and changes location in seconds, However, you need to note that you have to jailbreak your phone.

But if you are a jailbreak expert, this is a very comfortable GPS Changer for iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Cyndia LocationFaker app from the official website. LocationFaker8 is available for the iOS 8.0 model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-app-download-pic16.jpg"                      alt="cydia app download"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: After launching the app, enter the virtual location into the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/enter-new-location-pic17.jpg"                      alt="enter new location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: If you are done with choosing the new location, shift the toggle from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ at the bottom of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cydia-toggle-shift-pic18.jpg"                      alt="cydia toggle shift"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now we can decide which apps can access our new virtual location. At the bottom of the page, you will find an ‘i’ icon. Go click on it and choose the ‘White List’ option. This one will then take you to the app list and you can decide which of them will have access to the phone’s location.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-5G-using-Location-Handle"><a href="#Part-5-Change-GPS-Location-on-Oppo-Reno-8T-5G-using-Location-Handle" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T 5G using Location Handle"></a>Part 5: Change GPS Location on Oppo Reno 8T 5G using Location Handle</h2><p>Location Handle is another useful application that you can use to change your location by a few meters or simply go with an automated movement system that changes your location gradually as if you are moving from one place to another.

No jumping.</p><p>- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour.
